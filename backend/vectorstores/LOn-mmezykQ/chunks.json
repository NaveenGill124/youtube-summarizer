  "Look  at  this.  This  real  asteroid  is  the size  of  a  building  and  it's  on  a collision  course  for  Earth.  But  can  you find  it?  No  one  else  did  either. At  9:00  a.m.  on  February  15th,  2013, it's  a  normal  morning  in  Chelabinsk, Russia,  when  suddenly  people  see something  bright  in  the  sky.  Some  even feel  the  air  get  hotter.  Above  them, that  building  sized  rock  hits  our atmosphere  going  67,000 kilometers  per  hour  and  23  km  up,  it explodes.  People  come  to  their  windows to  see  what  happened.  But  90  seconds later,  the  shock  wave  hits. Within  4  days,  debris  from  that  blast circles  our  entire  planet.  And  the scariest  part  is  no  one  saw  it  coming. >> Scientists  had  no  idea  this  was  coming. >> And  it  could  have  been  disastrous.  What if  that  rock  had  been  bigger?  Imagine it's  2034  and  a  rock  the  size  of  a mountain  somewhere  far  off  in  our  solar system  is  on  a  direct  impact  course  for us.  How  would  we  know?  And  what  could  we actually  do  about  it?  In  this  video, we'll  play  out  a  fictional  asteroid headed  for  Earth  with  some  help  from  my friend  and  former  NASA  engineer  Mark Robber  and  rare  access  into  a  remote facility  where  they  discover  new asteroids.  Oh,  look  at  that.  What  do  you got? >> Is  that  real?  To  show  you  all  of  the amazing  real  science  and  tech  that  we would  use  to  defend  our  planet  if  an asteroid  is  about  to  hit  Earth. [Music] So,  in  order  to  make  sure  that  you  know what's  real  versus  what's  our  fictional asteroid  crisis,  I  asked  Mark  Robber  to voice  the  fiction  sections.  and  it turned  out  so  fun. >> Let's  go.

  "asteroid  crisis,  I  asked  Mark  Robber  to voice  the  fiction  sections.  and  it turned  out  so  fun. >> Let's  go. It's  3:00  a.m.  on  June  1st,  2034. Scientists  inside  Catalina  Sky  Survey  in Arizona  have  been  awake  all  night hunting  for  asteroids.  Their  telescope is  taking  time-lapse  pictures  of  the night  sky  in  a  grid  like  this.  Each  spot of  the  sky  is  photographed  four  times, moments  apart,  and  that  lets  them  find moving  asteroids  against  the  stable stars  in  the  background.  Oh  boy,  I'm already  nervous.  Cleo, >> you  got  this. >> It's  slow  work  and  they're  tired,  but new  photos  just  came  in. >> Wait, that  can't  be  right.  That  looks  like  a new  fastm  moving  point  of  light  against the  sky.  Is  that  what  I  think  it  is?  Is that  what  I  think  it  is? >> Yes.  Right  now,  we're  at  the  real Catalina  Sky  Survey  because  they've invited  us  to  spend  the  night  with  them while  they  hunt  for  real  asteroids. Since  the  1990s,  this  place  and  places like  it  around  the  world  have  scanned the  sky  while  we're  all  asleep,  hunting for  dangerous  objects  that  might  hit  us. Together,  these  groundbased observatories  have  detected  the  majority of  the  near-Earth  asteroids  that  we  know about,  over  39,000 so  far.  We  don't  think  about  it  very often,  but  our  planet  is  in  a  constant high  stakes  dodgeball  game,  and  we  can't dodge.  So,  our  only  hope  is  to  identify asteroids  long  enough  in  advance  to  do something  about  it.  We're  the  only species  to  ever  have  a  hope  of  doing that  for  anyone  else  when  an  asteroid comes. The  asteroid  that  killed  the  dinosaurs was  wider  than  Mount  Everest  is  tall. But  what  I  didn't  realize  is  that asteroid,  it  wasn't  that  big.  At least not  compared  to  other  asteroids  that have  actually  hit  Earth  before.  Imagine hunks  of  rock  or  metal,  all  different shapes,  up  to  about  the  size  of  a 10-story  building.  There  are  likely millions  of  these  flying  around  closer to  us  than  Mars,  and  they  hit  us  all  the time.  But  our  atmosphere  protects  us. These  small  asteroids  almost  always  burn up  long  before  they  reach  us  on  the ground.  But  asteroids  get  bigger.  From the  size  of  a  building  to  about  two  city blocks,  there  are  likely  hundreds  of",
  "10-story  building.  There  are  likely millions  of  these  flying  around  closer to  us  than  Mars,  and  they  hit  us  all  the time.  But  our  atmosphere  protects  us. These  small  asteroids  almost  always  burn up  long  before  they  reach  us  on  the ground.  But  asteroids  get  bigger.  From the  size  of  a  building  to  about  two  city blocks,  there  are  likely  hundreds  of thousands  of  asteroids  this  size  near us.  On  June  30th,  1908,  a  rock  50  meters across  grazed  our  atmosphere  over Siberia.  It  never  even  hit  the  ground, but  just  the  shock  wave  flattened  80 million  trees.  And  if  it  had  hit,  well, an  asteroid  impact  is  worse  than  you might  think.  Most  people  imagine  an asteroid  hitting  Earth  like  a  bullet hitting  a  wall. But  an  asteroid  is  not  like  that.  An asteroid  is  almost  always  going  so  fast that  when  it  hits,  much  of  it immediately  turns  from  a  solid  into  a superheated  gas  that  explodes  outward. And  the  energy  of  that  explosion  is insane.  A  50  m  asteroid  would  release the  energy  equivalent  of  around  500 nuclear  bombs.  That's  why  this  size  is called  a  city  killer.  But  they  get bigger.  Anything  this  size  would  wipe out  a  whole  country.  And  anything  bigger than  that,  all  life  on  Earth  would change  forever.  That  rock  that  hit  the dinosaurs  caused  mega  tsunamis,  a thermal  pulse  of  heat  and  fire,  dust  and ash  that  blocked  out  the  sun  for  a decade  or  more.  But  that's  nowhere  close to  the  largest  rock  that  has  ever  hit Earth.  1.8  billion  years  ago,  a  rock nearly  15  km  wide  slammed  into  what's now  Canada.  And  170  million  years  before that,  the  largest  asteroid  that  we  have evidence  of  ever  hitting  Earth,  20 kilometers  wide,  struck  what  is  now South  Africa.  If  you'd  been  on  the ground  and  looked  up,  an  asteroid  that size  would  look  something  like  this.  And even  bigger  than  that,  it's  theorized that  an  object  the  size  of  Mars  hit Earth  about  4.5  billion  years  ago.  And that's  how  our  moon  was  formed.  But something  I  found  interesting  when talking  to  experts  about  this  is  that not  all  asteroids  hit  our  planet  the same.  An  asteroid  made  of  ice  and  rocky debris  might  hit  our  atmosphere  and",
  "even  bigger  than  that,  it's  theorized that  an  object  the  size  of  Mars  hit Earth  about  4.5  billion  years  ago.  And that's  how  our  moon  was  formed.  But something  I  found  interesting  when talking  to  experts  about  this  is  that not  all  asteroids  hit  our  planet  the same.  An  asteroid  made  of  ice  and  rocky debris  might  hit  our  atmosphere  and break  apart,  burning  up  on  entry,  while a  dense  metal  asteroid  of  the  same  size could  pierce  straight  through  and  maybe do  more  serious  damage.  But  the  good news  is  that  based  on  our  rate  of discovery  and  computer  models  of  our early  solar  system,  astronomers  say  that we've  already  found  about  95  to  98%  of the  really  big  asteroids,  the  ones  about a  kilometer  wide  or  more.  As  of  today, there  are  exactly  877  of  them.  And scientists  track  them  very  closely.  And luckily,  none  of  them  are  on  track  to hit  us.  But  those  city  and  country killers,  for  the  country  killers,  they think  we've  only  found  42  to  47%  of them.  And  for  the  city  killers,  the number  is  much,  much  less.  And  we're much  less  certain  about  that  percentage. That  is  the  biggest  hole  in  Earth's defenses  right  now.  And  that  is  what people  all  around  the  world  are  staying up  all  night  trying  to  fix.  And  I'm about  to  become  one  of  them. [Music] So,  we  just  opened  the  doors  to  the telescope.  We're  now  all  set  to  start the  observation  run.  We  just  have  to wait  until  it  gets  darker  and  then  we can  start  hunting  asteroids.  They  told us  that  based  on  the  weather,  we  might find  a  brand  new  asteroid  tonight.  So,  I have  my  fingers  crossed. As  we  waited  for  the  sun  to  go  down,  I found  out  something  that  made  me  very excited. >> If  you  find  a  new  asteroid,  you  get  to put  your  name  on  it.  And  I  really, really  want  to  do  that. >> But  it  turns  out  finding  a  new  asteroid is  way  harder  than  I  thought. >> So,  this  is  a  map  of  the  night  sky  that shows  the  coverage  from  this  telescope over  about  the  last  uh  2  weeks.  We'll cover  the  entire  night  sky  about  twice  a month. >> The  telescope  takes  pictures  of  12  spots of  sky  at  a  time,  each  four  times  in  a cycle.  So  the  four  images  of  each  spot are  brief  moments  apart.  And  then  an automated  system  analyzes  each  set  and shows  the  observer  just  the  maybe options.  The  vast  majority  of  those  are still  nos. >> That's  you  see  the  N  key  is  a  little worn  down  on  the  keyboard.  That's  the key  we  hit  the  most.",

Not  real. >> Not  real.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope. Definitely  nope.  This  went  on  for  hours. David  and  I  took  turns  and  I  really wanted  to  stay  awake.  So,  I  did  a  ton  of push-ups  and  I  drank  a  ton  of  coffee. And  when  I  was  at  the  observatory,  I drank  whatever  coffee  they  had.  But  when I'm  at  home  and  I  can  choose,  this  is the  really  good  stuff.  It's  from Cometier.  And  the  reason  why  I  love  it so  much  is  because  it's  delicious.  I genuinely  drink  their  coffee  all  the time.  And  because  it's  genuinely  cool technology.  Even  if  you  buy  great  coffee beans,  it's  hard  to  make  a  great  coffee at  home.  And  that's  why  I've  been  using Comet.  This  is  the  first  coffee  that's brewed  to  perfection  and  then  flash frozen  at  peak  freshness,  which  makes  a big  difference  when  it  comes  to  taste. So,  Cometier  goes  out  and  they  find  the best  beans  from  roasters  around  the world  like  Intelligencia  and  Onyx.  And then  they  brew  the  coffee  at  10  times the  strength  of  a  normal  cup  and  they flash  freeze  it  into  a  capsule  like this.  Then  I  can  just  take  that  capsule and  without  a  machine,  you  can  just  pop it  out  like  this  using  the  eject  button. And  then  you  can  make  it  hot  or  iced  or an  iced  latte.  Boom.  the  perfect  cup every  single  time  and  it  took  less  than a  minute.  Plus,  it's  got  twice  the flavor  and  caffeine  of  a  regular  cup. Perfection right  now.  This  one  is  my  favorite flavor,  but  you  should  try  it  out  and comment  yours.  So,  if  you're  sitting here  and  you're  thinking,  \"Man,  I  would love  a  good  cup  of  coffee.\"  Try Cometier.  I  think  you'll  like  it.  And  if you  haven't  tried  Comet,  you  can  get  $20 off  your  Discovery  Box  featuring  eight unique  coffees  curated  by  World  Barista Champ  James  Hoffman  by  visiting commenter.com/cleo or  visiting  the  link  in  my  description. But  back  at  the  observatory,  it  was  hard to  stay  awake.  And  at  a  certain  point,  I found  myself  wondering,  why  is  it  that you  need  to  be  physically  here  as opposed  to  you  have  this  amazing software,  it  detects  these  images,  you come  in  tomorrow  morning  and  you  say, \"That's  real.  That's  not  real.  That's real.  That's  not  real.\" >> The  turnaround  time  on  the  data  is critical >> because  those  four  images,  they  only show  a  tiny  little  piece  of  an asteroid's  path.  So,  if  you  waited  until the  morning,  you'd  probably  lose  it.  If",

So,  if  you  waited  until the  morning,  you'd  probably  lose  it.  If you  don't  continue  to  track  that  object and  publish  it  immediately,  it  literally can  get  lost. >> So,  when  you  find  something,  you immediately  send  it  to  what's  called  the minor  planet  center  to  check  if  someone else  has  already  found  it.  And  if  it's  a new  object,  other  telescopes  around  the world  lock  onto  its  position  to  help build  out  its  orbital  path  for  the foreseeable  future.  This  is  all  public. Anybody  with  a  telescope  can  help,  and we'd  all  need  to  help  if  anyone  found anything  big  enough. The  observers  are  still  staring  at  that moving  speck  of  light.  Something  that bright  is  likely  an  object  we  know  about already.  So,  they  report  it  to  the  Minor Planet  Center.  And  normally,  they'd  be hoping  to  make  a  new  discovery.  But today,  they're  just  hoping  their suspicion  is  wrong.  And  as  soon  as  the report  comes  back,  the  whole  team  goes silent.  No  one's  ever  seen  this  thing before.  It's  a  new  asteroid,  and  it's big. Cleo,  you're  making  me  narrate  the  end of  our  species.  Astronomers  around  the world  spring  into  action.  They  need  to know  how  big  and  what  it's  made  of.  And most  importantly,  will  it  hit  us?  How will  they  know  what  it's  made  of  from their  telescopes? >> You're  about  to  find  out. >> Cleo,  you've  thought  of  everything. >> Breaking  news. >> Reports  of  a  new >> concerning  news  emerging  report  just  in. >> Scientists  are  warning.  There  are  rumors of  an  asteroid or  what  level  is  beginning  to  wonder, >> are  we  in  danger? >> The  new  asteroid  gets  its  official  name, 2034  LV1.  But  as  news  spread, astronomers  nickname  it  Sotyia  after  the Greek  goddess  of  safety.  It's  a  bad joke.  Data  is  now  beginning  to  stream  in from  around  the  world.  And  it's  not good.  Sotaria  isn't  just  big,  it's really  big.  Observatories  shoot  radio waves  at  it  and  time  how  long  it  takes the  echoes  to  return,  measuring  its  size and  shape  with  high  precision.  It's  400 m  across.  A  country  killer.  And  what's worse,  it's  dense.  Every  mineral  and metal  reflects  light  in  its  own  pattern. So  scientists  analyze  the  light  bouncing",

A  country  killer.  And  what's worse,  it's  dense.  Every  mineral  and metal  reflects  light  in  its  own  pattern. So  scientists  analyze  the  light  bouncing off  Sotaria  like  a  fingerprint.  And  it turns  out  it's  made  of  nickel  and  iron. And  it's  fast.  By  carefully  mapping  its position  in  the  sky,  they  see  it's racing  through  space  at  roughly  75,000 km  per  hour  relative  to  Earth.  Why didn't  we  see  it  before?  Scientists check  back  in  all  Earth  records.  Turns out  it  was  too  close  to  the  sun. Whenever  it  was  observable,  it  was  in the  daytime  sky.  The  only  question  that really  matters  now  is  will  it  hit  us? Analysts  put  all  the  tracking  data  into the  world's  most  powerful  computers  and solve  for  Sotaria's  trajectory  around the  sun  compared  to  ours.  At  first,  the odds  of  impact  are  2%.  That's  already huge  by  astronomical  standards.  But  as more  and  more  data  comes  in,  that  impact probability  climbs  higher  and  higher until  we  know  there's  nearly  90%  chance Saria  will  hit  us  when  it  comes  back around  in  October  2041.  But  all  this learning  takes  time.  Months  have  gone by.  Now  it's  already  2035.  And  now  we know  the  question  isn't  if  Sotaria  will hit  us.  It's  what  can  we  do  about  it. With  an  impact  date  of  2041,  we  have  6 years  warning.  6  years  to  do  something. So  let's  let's  pretend  this  is  your  400 m  wide  object. >> There  it  is.  That's  my  object. >> That's  your  object.  So  it's  coming  in. And  what  you'll  notice  is  that  it  has  uh an  orbit  that  intersects  the  Earth's orbit.  very  closely.  You  might  think  you have  to  do  this  dramatic  thing  to  move this  asteroid  out  of  the  way,  but  you don't. >> So,  what's  the  real  plan?  If  an  asteroid that  big  actually  were  coming  for  Earth, what  do  we  do?  Well,  in  2013,  the  United Nations  created  two  groups  for  exactly this  situation.  One  to  gather information  from  astronomers  around  the world  and  share  it  with  governments  and the  other  to  bring  the  space  agencies together  to  make  a  plan.  Imagine  being in  that  meeting.  Here  are  your  real options.  Option  one,  you  do  nothing. That  doesn't  seem  like  a  great  plan,  but there  is  still  a  chance  that  it  misses us.  Option  two,  you  smash  a  spacecraft",
  "this  situation.

Option  two,  you  smash  a  spacecraft into  the  asteroid  to  change  its  path just  enough  so  that  it  misses  Earth. That  might  sound  like  science  fiction, but  we've  actually  done  this  in  real life.  In  2022,  NASA  deliberately  slammed a  spacecraft  the  size  of  a  vending machine  into  an  asteroid  the  size  of  a few  city  blocks.  It  was  called  the  Dart mission.  The  asteroid  wasn't  headed  for Earth.  It  was  just  a  test.  dart  hit  the asteroid  at  22,000  km  per  hour  and  it worked. In  fact,  it  was  way  more  successful  than they  expected.  NASA's  goal  was  to  change the  asteroid's  path  by  73  seconds.  And instead,  they  ended  up  changing  it  by  32 minutes,  25  times  more  effective.  And DART  was  small,  but  there  are  already blueprints  for  a  bigger  mission,  like Hammer.  Hammer  would  be  modular, multiple  parts  stacked  together  like Legos.  And  altogether,  it  would  be  much, much  more  massive  than  dart.  Basically, a  big  space  battering  ram  for  defending Earth.  But  the  downside  of  this  option is  it  only  works  if  you  have  enough warning.  You  need  years  to  build  and launch  the  spacecraft  and  hit  the asteroid  and  let  that  tiny  little  nudge add  up  into  a  miss.  So,  you  might  want to  also  consider  option  three.  You  nuke the  asteroid,  but  not  to  explode  it  like in  a  movie,  because  that  might  actually create  a  bunch  of  dangerous  fragments that  would  get  pulled  back  together  by gravity  and  hit  us  anyway.  Instead,  the idea  is  that  you  nuke  an  asteroid  just on  one  side  to  vaporize  part  of  its surface,  turning  that  asteroid  into  a rocket.  My  understanding  of  this  is  that you  uh  basically  set  one  side  of  it >> on  fire  and  it  makes  itself  into  a rocket.  Is  that  right? >> Yeah.  And  you  know  what?  We  see  that naturally  with  comets. >> Yeah.  So  comets  when  they're  in  orbit around  the  sun  as  they  come  in  close  and the  ices  start  to  off  gas  those  jets  can push  the  comets  in  weird  ways  which  is kind  of  cool.  So  we  see  that  naturally, >> but  we  have  never  tried  this  with  an asteroid.  And  now  the  ideas  are  getting a  little  bit  less  serious.  Like  there's an  idea  of  an  ion  beam  deflector  where",

So  we  see  that  naturally, >> but  we  have  never  tried  this  with  an asteroid.  And  now  the  ideas  are  getting a  little  bit  less  serious.  Like  there's basically  a  spacecraft  moves  alongside the  asteroid  and  shoots  charged particles  at  it  to  get  it  to  change  its path.  Or  a  cosmic  bullet  where  we  place long  sharp  rods  of  tungsten  in  the  path of  the  asteroid  and  when  it  hits  them, the  rods  penetrate  and  break  the asteroid  apart.  or  a  gravity  tractor, which  is  like  a  really  big  spacecraft that  tries  to  move  the  asteroid  with  its own  gravity. >> I  feel  like  that  probably  wouldn't  be the  best  option  on  such  a  short  time frame.  You're  you're  going  to  be  I  I think  you're  going  to  need  to  be  a little  more  dramatic  about  your approach. >> After  weeks  of  debate,  the  space agencies  in  the  world  announce  that they've  chosen  option  two,  smash  it. Here's  the  plan.  The  whole  world  will work  together  to  build  and  launch  two enormous  kinetic  impactor  spacecraft.  If one  doesn't  work,  the  second  can  get  it done.  If  both  work,  even  better.  The goal  is  to  just  slightly  speed  up  or slow  down  Sierra's  orbit  by  just  a  few millimeters  per  second,  which  over  the years  would  cause  it  to  arrive  at  the impact  point  either  too  early  or  too late,  and  Earth  just  wouldn't  be  there. This  is  the  highest  stakes,  most complicated  mission  humanity  has  ever done,  and  everyone  has  to  do  their  part. NASA  and  SpaceX  build  one  launch  vehicle and  kinetic  impactor  while  Rose  Cosmos and  CNSA  build  the  other.Sa  builds  the observer  spacecraft  to  accompany  both. JAXA  and  ISRO  each  send  spacecraft  ahead to  sample  the  asteroid  and  confirm  the math.  After  almost  2  years  of  the  world pulling  together  for  this  mission  in  May 2037,  mission  Saria  is  ready. >> 3  2  1 and  lift  off.  It'll  take  5  months  to reach  the  asteroid.  The  world  holds their  breath  as  the  ships  begin  their journey. >> Back  on  Earth,  I'm  still  hunting  for  new asteroids,  but  it's  getting  later  and later,  and  I'm  losing  hope  that  we're going  to  find  anything.  And  then  all  of a  sudden, >> so  this  score  is  pretty  good.  Let's  see what  Oh,  look  at  that.  What  do  you  got? >> Is  that  real? >> That  is  real.  Yeah.  What  did  you  get?",
  "journey. >> Back  on  Earth,  I'm  still  hunting  for  new asteroids,  but  it's  getting  later  and later,  and  I'm  losing  hope  that  we're going  to  find  anything.  And  then  all  of a  sudden, >> so  this  score  is  pretty  good.  Let's  see what  Oh,  look  at  that.  What  do  you  got? >> Is  that  real? >> That  is  real.  Yeah.  What  did  you  get? So,  now  the  next  step,  okay,  you  have  to determine  if  this  is  a  new  object.  Okay. Don't  get  too  excited  because  it  might it  might  not  be  new.  So,  hit  the  U  key. >> So,  we  reported  what  we  found  to  the minor  planet  center. >> Oh  my  god,  this  suspense  is  killing  me. This  is  a  very  stressful  job. >> How  big  do  we  ask  for  this? >> Based  on  its  speed  and  where  in  the  sky we  found  it.  It's  already  getting  lit  up pretty  well.  I'm  just  going  to  ballpark it  at  maybe  50  m.  So, >> I'll  take  50  m.  That's  a  dangerous smaller. >> That's  a  dangerous  freaking  asteroid. >> A  dangerous  asteroid.  Yeah.  When  the check  is  finished,  they'll  email  us  and they'll  say,  \"This  was  new.  knew  this was  not  new.  And  if  it  was  new,  they're going to  publish  it  immediately  for everyone  in  the  world  to  see.  We  can check  this  page  and  see  if  it  posted. >> There  it  is. >> Yep.  Zero  hours  ago. >> That's  our  asteroid. >> Yep. >> And  uh  my  my  size  estimate  was  not  too bad.  56  m. >> Wow. >> Yep.  56.  Yeah.  Not  a  bad  guess.  Yeah. This >> is  a  brand  new  asteroid  and  you  were literally  the  first  person  in  the  world to  see  it.  So, >> that's  really,  really  cool.  Thank  you for  setting  us  up  to  do  that. >> Yeah,  no  problem. >> And  your  name's  on  it. >> I  still  cannot  believe  that  we  actually found  a  new  asteroid.  That  is  the coolest  thing.  As  of  right  now,  our little  huge,  if  true,  asteroid  is  right here.  You  can  go  look  it  up.  I'll  put the  link  in  my  description.  You  can  see where  it's  going  to  go.  And  luckily,  it looks  like  it'll  never  hit  Earth.  But what  about  Sataria?  On  October  20th, 2037,  billions  of  people  watch  with  a few  minutes  delay  as  our  impactors hurdle  toward  Sutaria.  Will  it  hit?  And can  it  change  the  asteroid's  path  to save  us? >> 3 2 1. >> A  direct  hit.  Telescopes  record  a  bright flash  and  a  cloud  bursting  off  Sotaria's surface.

  "2 1. >> A  direct  hit.  Telescopes  record  a  bright flash  and  a  cloud  bursting  off  Sotaria's surface. [Applause] Calculations  show  the  impact  changed Syria's  orbital  period  around  the  sun  by a  few  minutes.  A  tiny  change,  but  that's all  we  need.  Scientists  now  believe Sotyia  will  miss  Earth.  I  actually  have chills. >> Yeah, >> I  actually  have  chills.  This  is  real chills.  We're  going  to  live.  I  love  this planet.  In  2041,  four  years  after  our spacecraft  smashed  into  it,  Sotaria whizzes  past  our  planet  and  everyone  on Earth  celebrates  that  day. Saria  is  just  imaginary,  but  the  science and  the  human  effort  here  are  very,  very real.  I  just  stayed  up  all  night  with the  real  researchers  who  are  dedicating their  lives  to  protecting  us.  I'm exhausted  and  they  do  this  all  the  time. We  are  one  of  millions  of  species  to roam  our  planet,  but  we  are  the  only ones  that  can  use  science  and  technology to  defend  us  all  and  all  of  the  rest  of life  on  Earth  from  space.  We  are  not helpless,  not  even  in  the  face  of  an enormous  asteroid.  I  know  it  might  be hard  to  see  sometimes,  but  there  are people  all  around  the  world  working together  to  protect  us  all  so  that  if the  day  ever  comes,  we'll  be  ready.  So, if  you  believe  that  there  should  be  more optimistic  science  and  tech  stories, subscribe  to  support  our  show.  And  if surviving  an  asteroid  wasn't  enough,  go watch  me  and  Mark  Robber  and  Johnny Harris  survive  an  escape  from  Alcatraz in  Mark's  new  video.  Huge  if  true."
