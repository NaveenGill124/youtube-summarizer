  "what  i  want  to  get  into  now  is  that really  practical  aspect  of  like breaking  that  pattern  right  because that's  where  most  of  us are  we  have  that  negative  self-talk  we have  the  victim  mindset we  have  the  i'm  busy  i've  got  too  much going  on i  am  overwhelmed  i'm  experiencing anxiety  it's  that  person  at  work it's  my  partner  like  we  have  that  that's reality of  where  we  are  today  yeah  how  do  we break  that  pattern in  a  way  that  actually  makes  a difference  and  is  easy  enough  as  a starting  point yeah  it's  been  said  that  you  should meditate  for  20  minutes  a  day unless  you're  really  busy  then  you should  meditate  for  an  hour  a  day  yeah  i love  that that's  why  by  the  way  that's  why  i meditate  for  two  hours  a  day  yeah so  look  i  mean  um  information  is  what opens  that  door  i  mean [Music] if  you  think  that  your  thoughts  have something  to  do  with  your  future just  from  a  theoretical  standpoint  that your  thoughts create  your  destiny  and  you  think  60  to 70  000 thoughts  in  one  day  and  90  of  those thoughts  are  the  same  thoughts  as  the day  before well  then  your  life  isn't  going  to change  very  much  as  long  as  you're thinking  the  same  way and  those  those  same  thoughts  lead  to the  same  choices  the  same  choices  lead to  the  same  behaviors the  same  behaviors  create  the  exact  same experiences and  we  anticipate  the  same  feelings  or emotions from  those  experiences  and  those emotions  are  the  payoff  that  drive  our very  same  thoughts  well  our  biology  our neurocircuitry neurochemistry  our  hormones  and  even  our gene  expression will  be  equal  to  how  we  think  how  we  act and  how  we  feel and  how  we  think  how  we  act  and  how  we feel  is  called  our  personality and  our  personality  creates  our  personal reality  that's  it so  the  present  personality  who's listening  to  this  show has  created  the  present  personal  reality called  their  life so  if  you  can  latch  on  to  this  idea  if you  want  to  create  a  new  life a  new  personal  reality  you  got  to  change your  personality  which  means  you  better",
  "feel  is  called  our  personality and  our  personality  creates  our  personal reality  that's  it so  the  present  personality  who's listening  to  this  show has  created  the  present  personal  reality called  their  life so  if  you  can  latch  on  to  this  idea  if you  want  to  create  a  new  life a  new  personal  reality  you  got  to  change your  personality  which  means  you  better start thinking  about  what  you've  been  thinking about  and  changing  it  you  begin  to become  conscious  of  your  unconscious actions  or  habits  or  behaviors  and modify  them and  then  we  have  to  begin  to  look  at  the emotions  that  we  live  by  every  single day that  are  keep  us  connected  to  the  past and  decide  do  these  emotions  belong in  our  future  so  most  people  are  trying to  create  a  new  personal  reality as  the  same  personality  and  it  doesn't work  you  literally  have  to  become someone  else  so  the  principal neuroscience  says  that  nerve  cells  that fire  together  wire  together you  keep  thinking  the  same  way  making the  same  choices  demonstrating  the  same habits  creating  the  same  experiences that  stamp  the  same  networks  of  neurons into  the  same  patterns all  for  the  familiar  feeling  called  you and  you  do  that  for  10  years  on  end you're  gonna  begin  to  hardwire  certain patterns  in  your  brain  that  becomes  your identity and  by  the  time  we're  35  years  old  it kind  of  becomes fixed  right  then  psychology  used  to  say that  you  can't  change  that  but we  now  know  that  you  can  so  then  that kind  of box  in  the  brain  that  is  the  habit  of ourselves  it's  a uh  we're  95  of  the  time  running  a  series of  programs  so  then sitting  and  doing  the  work  we  have  to become disentangled  from  those  programs  and  so the  moment  you  decide  to  do  something differently  or  make  a  new  choice what  most  people  don't  want  to  face  is that  discomfort and  that  that  discomfort  that  that uncertainty  that lack  of  predictability  the  that  that that  unknown  is  what  people  are  afraid of  because  they'd  rather live  in  guilt  at  least  they  can  predict who  they're  going  to  be  then  take  a chance  in  possibility so  when  a  person  begins  to  understand this  and  you  say  well how  long  have  you  been  this  way  and  they say  i've  been  like  this  for  35  years  and you  say why  35  years  because  35  years  ago  i  had this  one  event well  the  stronger  the  emotion  you  feel from  reaction  from  that  event  the  more",
  "who  they're  going  to  be  then  take  a chance  in  possibility so  when  a  person  begins  to  understand this  and  you  say  well how  long  have  you  been  this  way  and  they say  i've  been  like  this  for  35  years  and you  say why  35  years  because  35  years  ago  i  had this  one  event well  the  stronger  the  emotion  you  feel from  reaction  from  that  event  the  more altered  you  feel  inside  of  you the  more  the  brain  narrows  its  focus  and freezes  the  image and  takes  a  snapshot  and  that's  called the  memory  right  so  then forget  the  memory  just  overcome  the emotion  because  it's  the  emotion  that keeps  you  anchored  to  the  past  so that  sounds  really  good  theoretically but  when  you  step  out  into  that  unknown into  that  void the  body  really  is  in  a  habit  and  what habit  is  when  the  body  becomes  the  mind or  if  you're  thinking  about  that  past event and  it's  producing  an  emotion  well  you need  an image  and  a  feeling  to  start  the conditioning  process  so  the  body's either  conditioned  into  the familiar  past  or  it's  hardwired  in  the predictable  future  because  it  wakes  up every  single  day  and  runs  through  the same  series  of  routine  actions so  the  present  moment  then  becomes  the unknown when  people  start  feeling  that discomfort  jay  they'd  rather  get  on their  cell  phone  and  call  someone  or get  up  and  say  i  can't  meditate  or  you know  i  have  too  much  to  do  they  excuse themselves  they  return  back  into  that familiar  feeling  because the  bodies  actually  telling  the  brain the habit  is  when  the  body  becomes  the  mind so  the  body  stepping  out  into  the unknown  and  says  ooh i'd  rather  feel  guilty  i'd  rather  feel unhappy than  be  in  this  discomfort  so  then  at least  then  when  they  return  back  to  that familiar  feeling  then  they  feel  safe  so they  step  out  in  the  unknown  and  the body  starts  influencing  the  mind  saying you  can  start  tomorrow you're  too  busy  it's  your  mother's  fault you  know  it's  your  culture's  fault i  don't  have  enough  money  this  isn't going  to  work those  are  the  programs  in  there  that  are standing  in  the  way  between  you and  your  future  so  then  nerve  cells  that no  longer  fire  together no  longer  wire  together  so  the  act  of observing  those  states  of  mind  and  body means  you're  no  longer  the  program you're  the  consciousness observing  that  program  so  so  then to  meditate  it  means  to  become  familiar",
  "and  your  future  so  then  nerve  cells  that no  longer  fire  together no  longer  wire  together  so  the  act  of observing  those  states  of  mind  and  body means  you're  no  longer  the  program you're  the  consciousness observing  that  program  so  so  then to  meditate  it  means  to  become  familiar with  so  as  you  become  familiar  with those  thoughts  you  become  conscious  of how  you  speak you  become  aware  of  how  you  act  you notice  how  you're  feeling the  more  conscious  you  become  of  those unconscious  programs the  less  unconscious  you'll  go  in  your waking  day  why because  it's  not  enough  to  just  have  a great  meditation  and  get  up  and  get  on the  freeway  and  get  in  traffic  and getting  stressed you  just  return  back  to  the  old  self again  our  job  then is  to  sustain  that  modified  state  of mind  and  body  the  entire  day and  if  you  can  get  ready  because something different  or  unusual  is  going  to  begin to  happen  in  your  life  and  it  will  come as  a  coincidence  or  a  synchronicity and  that's  breadcrumbs  from  the  divine saying  you're  on  the  path  just  keep doing  it there'll  be  another  one  just  keep staying  in  that  energy and  so  teaching  people  then to  understand  that  there's  a  formula that  we  now know  that  if  you  apply  that  formula you'll  begin  to  see  those  changes  and now  as  people  are  doing  it more  and  more  effectively the  results  are  going  up  as  well  we  just had  bond  university  they  just  took  a whole  bunch of  my  brain  scans  from  10  years  ago huge  clinical  study  a  lot  of  analysis and and  they're  blown  away  by the  speed  in  which  the  community  can change brain  or  heart  coherence  they  they  know how  to  do  it  it's  not uh  something  that's  that's  separate  from them  they've  practiced  it  enough  times that they  they  now  know  how  to  do  it  so what's  the  significance  of  that well  really  simple  in  your  life if  you  start  returning  back  to  the  same reactions  to  the  same  people  and circumstances  you're  returning  back  to the  old  self  so you  got  to  stay  conscious  in  your  life and and  if  you're  not  being  defined  by  a vision  of  the  future then  you're  left  with  the  memories  of the  past  and  you  will  be  predictable  in",
  "if  you  start  returning  back  to  the  same reactions  to  the  same  people  and circumstances  you're  returning  back  to the  old  self  so you  got  to  stay  conscious  in  your  life and and  if  you're  not  being  defined  by  a vision  of  the  future then  you're  left  with  the  memories  of the  past  and  you  will  be  predictable  in your  life  so crossing  that  river  of  change  from  the old  self  to  the  new  self there's  a  neurological  a  biological chemical  hormonal  a  genetic death  of  the  old  self  but  if  you  teach people  there's  something  on  the  other side they  won't  give  up  on  themselves  they'll keep  going  so  there's  enough  evidence to  encourage  people  and  you  can't  tell me  you're  too  old  to  do  this  work you  can't  tell  me  you're  too  sick  to  do this  work  you  can't  tell  me  you  had  a turbulent  past  or  or  that  you're  too overweight  or  too  underweight  or  too  out of  shape  or you  can't  even  tell  me  that  you've  never meditated  before  in  fact  some  of  our greatest scans  or  people  who  just  have  never meditated  before  that  are  not  trying  to do  anything  they  just  follow instructions so  our  community  now  is  beginning  to understand  that  it  is  possible and  they  go  all  in  not  50  and  not sixty  percent  and  we  do  a  week-long event  we  got  a  thousand  people  or fifteen  hundred  people  and  they  are all  in  and  that  when  they  start  getting beyond  themselves  that  first  day  or second  day once  they  start  getting  beyond themselves  and  that magic  starts  to  happen  then  i  have  no idea  i  can't  predict what's  going  to  happen  next  and  it's usually  pretty  pretty  exciting  it's  been said  that when  the  pain  of  staying  the  same outweighs the  pain  of  change  then  we  will  change yes  exactly  right  how  bad  does  it  have to  get yeah  exactly  and  it's  like  why  why  is  it that  we  get  so attached  to  that  old  self  like  what  is it  about  is  it  security  is  it  safety  is it familiarity  as  you  said  is  it  what  is that  that  keeps  us so  attached  and  so  focused  on  something that  we  don't  even  like  that  much  i think  uh  i  think  we've  been hypnotized  and  conditioned  into  becoming materialists i  think  um  that  we  define  reality  with our  senses  and  i  think  that is  one  of  the  biggest  delusions  so  the fundamental  question  is  can  you  believe in  a  future that  you  can't  see  or  experience  with your  senses  yet  but  you've  thought  about enough  times  in  your  mind that  your  brain  is  literally  changed  to look  like  the  event  has  already  occurred",
  "our  senses  and  i  think  that is  one  of  the  biggest  delusions  so  the fundamental  question  is  can  you  believe in  a  future that  you  can't  see  or  experience  with your  senses  yet  but  you've  thought  about enough  times  in  your  mind that  your  brain  is  literally  changed  to look  like  the  event  has  already  occurred now  the  latest  research  in  plasticity says  that's  absolutely  possible and  can  you  select  a  new  possibility  in the  quantum  field and  begin  to  emotionally  embrace  that future  every  single  day to  such  a  degree  that  your  body  as  the unconscious  mind the  objective  mind  does  not  know  the difference  between  the  experience in  your  life  that's  creating  the  emotion and  the  emotion  that  you're  fabricating by  thought  alone  to  the  degree that  you  begin  to  signal  new  genes  and new  ways to  change  your  body  to  look  like  the experience  has  already  happened  now  yes the  latest  research  in  epigenetics  says it's  absolutely  possible  now  think  about this every  day  installing  the  circuitry every  day  conditioning  the  body  into  the emotion  of  the  future that  your  body  begins  to  change  to  look like  it's  already  happened  now  this  is where  it  gets fun  because  now  you  no  longer  have  to  go anywhere  to  get  it  now  it  begins  to  come to  you  you  become  the  vortex  or  the magnet  to  your  destiny so  then  people  who  come  out  of  their meditation  and  they  say  well  i  just focused  on  my  wealth  why  isn't  it  there well  you're  not  that  good  if  you're asking  why  isn't  it  there  you're  back  to the  old  person  again stay  in  that  state  for  an  extended period  of  time as  an  experiment  as  the  scientist  in your  life to  keep  your  energy  connected  to  the  to the  dream  of  your  future and  then  see  what  kind  of  effects  begin to  take  place without  moving  into  impatience without  moving  into  frustration  without starting  to  analyze  why  it  hasn't happened  or  when that  is  the  trap  of  defining  reality with  your  senses  so  you  have  the  thought of  your  future  and  you  don't  see  it  then you  experience  separation but  people  who  are  practicing  this  work they  have  the  thought  of  their  future and  they  feel  the  emotion  of  their future they're  still  connected  to  it  right  so that  takes  practice and  it's  just  learning  like  hitting  a golf  ball  hitting  a  tennis  ball",
  "that  is  the  trap  of  defining  reality with  your  senses  so  you  have  the  thought of  your  future  and  you  don't  see  it  then you  experience  separation but  people  who  are  practicing  this  work they  have  the  thought  of  their  future and  they  feel  the  emotion  of  their future they're  still  connected  to  it  right  so that  takes  practice and  it's  just  learning  like  hitting  a golf  ball  hitting  a  tennis  ball dancing  the  salsa  you  know  crocheting whatever  it  is you  gotta  you  gotta  start  out  staying real  conscious  and  learning  then  you  get good  at  it  and  it  gets  to  be instrumental  it  gets  to  be  fun  and that's that's  what  i  want  for  everybody  that the  act  of  creation should  be  of  blissful  playful  ecstatic loose free  process  and  um  and  so i  love  the  idea  of  people  taking  time out  of  their  lives to  prove  to  themselves  that  if  they're defined  by  the  vision  of  the  future then  they're  not  living  by  the  memories of  the  past  and  that's  where  the  unknown exists  so many  people  the  unknown  is  a  scary  place so  they  don't  see  that  future because  they're  used  to  seeing  that future  with  evidence  with  their  senses and  you  have  to  be  able  to  get  beyond that  and  stay  in  the  unknown stay  in  that  discomfort  and  then  in  that moment to  be  begin  to  self-regulate  like  oh  i'm starting  to  feel  a little  anxiety  ooh i'm  starting  to  feel  a little frustration  that's  the  defining  moment where  your  body's  going  back  to  the  past because  emotions  are  a  record  of  the past or  you  go  into  routine  again  so  you catch  yourself it's  a  victory  and  if  you  keep  catching yourself those  victories  add  up  and  it's  not  so much about  your  wealth  or  your  health  or  your freedom  or  your  new  relationship it's  actually  about  who  you  become  and so  overcoming  the  old  self allows  us  to  become  somebody  else  and there  is  that period  of  transition  yeah  i  call  it  the void  where  there's  just  not  a  lot happening and  you  just  got  to  be  able  to  keep going and  continuously  get  to  the  end  of  your belief where  most  people  stop  i  just  had  a fabulous  conversation  with  someone this  weekend  broke through  to  the  other  side  and  now there's  so  much  magic  happening  around this  person",
  "going and  continuously  get  to  the  end  of  your belief where  most  people  stop  i  just  had  a fabulous  conversation  with  someone this  weekend  broke through  to  the  other  side  and  now there's  so  much  magic  happening  around this  person but  she's  worthy  now  to  receive  it  and that's that  that  is  the  key  because  the universe  only  gives  us  what  we  think we're  worthy  of  receiving  so we  got  to  become  initiated  into  this  and understand  it thousands  of  years  of  programming  that says  that we  have  to  change  things  matter  to matter  you  know  in  three-dimensional reality  and it  will  take  time  but  to  begin  to connect  to  that  resource  called  the quantum  field  and  create  from  the  field instead  of  from  matter there's  a  lot  of  unlearning  that  has  to go  on  absolutely  and  when  you're catching  yourself what  are  you  doing  are  you  writing  that down  are  you  noting  that  down  are  you making  a  mental  note  like practically  what  is  someone  having  to  do to  once  they  catch  it  then  how  do  you deal  with  that emotion  and  anxiety  in  the  moment  that feels  so  heavy  that feels  so  real  real  and  trapping  and  like you  said  i  was  just  uh i  was  uh  the  facebook  headquarter quarters  in  menlo  park  a  couple  of  weeks ago i  was  testing  out  their  new  oculus  range of  virtual  reality and  all  the  studies  by  virtual  reality show  now  that  you  feel  the  same experience  of  hanging  off  the  edge  of  a cliff  in  virtual  reality and  your  body  displays  the  same  symptoms as  they  would  if  you  were  actually hanging  off  clinton  yeah so  just  showing  how  imagination  does mirror  the  other  way  too  through  virtual reality  but how  that  feels  so  real  like  our  body gets  when  you're  stepping  out  off  the ledge  you're  doing  it  as  if  it's  reality and  so  that  anxiety  feels  so  real  what do  you  do  after  catching  it  what  happens to  that  emotion well  you  know  just  like  anything  else jay  i  mean  it's  just  like in  the  golf  ball  you  get  back  into  a  bad habit  again  you  know you  have  to  really  begin  to mentally  rehearse  like  so  you  ask yourself  at  the  end  of  your  day i  do  this  every  day  how'd  i  do  how'd  i do  today  bro  how'd  you  do did  you  do  good  where'd  you  fall  from grace  what  what  what was  it  that  caused  you  to  go  unconscious for  the  rest  of  the  day  like  what  was that  moment now  if  you're  a  student  of  life",
  "yourself  at  the  end  of  your  day i  do  this  every  day  how'd  i  do  how'd  i do  today  bro  how'd  you  do did  you  do  good  where'd  you  fall  from grace  what  what  what was  it  that  caused  you  to  go  unconscious for  the  rest  of  the  day  like  what  was that  moment now  if  you're  a  student  of  life you'll  begin  to  contemplate  well  it  was that  person  that  said  that  thing  then  i reacted  or this  i  got  this  email  or  things  didn't go  my  way  and  i  started  feeling  angry  or frustrated  or  fearful the  next  time  that  happens  how  could  i evolve  my  experience  now you  may  have  to  search  for  some  answers of  the  best  model  to  build  or  you  may actually  have  a  long  contemplation  and start  to  go god  the  next  time  that  happens  i  think i'm  going  to  do  this  or  i'm  going  to  do that  or  i'm  going  to  plan  my  behaviors and  the  act  of  closing  your  eyes and  rehearsing  what  you're  going  to  do begins  to  install  the  neurological hardware  in  your  brain  to  look  like  you already  did  it now  the  brain  is  no  longer  a  record  of the  past  now  it's  a  map  to  the  future and  if  you keep  installing  that  hardware  the hardware  will  become  a  software  program which  means you'll  just  start  acting  like  a  happy person  why  there's  no  magic  there you  install  the  circuitry  so  that's more  important  than  the  news  right it's  more  important  than  answering  any email  or  any  text it's  more  important  than  talking  about your  past or  some  dinner  if  you  can  begin  to  just think  about  how  you're  going  to  do  it differently  that's  the  building  process neurologically  already  so now  you  have  to  get  conscious  in  order to  do  that  and  it  takes  some  time  it means you  got  to  shut  your  cell  phone  off  you got  to  close  your  door  you  got  to  take  a break  from  everything  out  there and  begin  to  practice  and  so  by experience  then you  start  noticing  oh  here  it  comes  here comes  the  frustration here  comes  the  fear  and  now  we've  given people  the  tools  to  be  able  to self-regulate to  create  brain  and  heart  coherence  and so  you  see  people  say excuse  me  one  minute  i'm  just  gonna  need a  minute  it  takes  some  breaths  they  get back  in  they  connect  to  the  energy  of their  future  this is  incidental  compared  to  where  they're going so  they  don't  fall  from  grace  they  don't",
  "people  the  tools  to  be  able  to self-regulate to  create  brain  and  heart  coherence  and so  you  see  people  say excuse  me  one  minute  i'm  just  gonna  need a  minute  it  takes  some  breaths  they  get back  in  they  connect  to  the  energy  of their  future  this is  incidental  compared  to  where  they're going so  they  don't  fall  from  grace  they  don't allow  their  energy  to  drop  and  so  yeah in  the  beginning it  takes  a  lot  because  it  takes  a  lot  of energy  and  awareness to  stay  conscious  and  not  go  unconscious but  if  you're  persistent and  you're  determined  and  you're  sincere you  begin  to  figure  it  out you  begin  to  say  i  am  not  going  to  give my  power  away  to  that  person  or  that circumstance  when  i  can  use  it  to  heal or  to  create  a  new  future and  so  people  then  won't  excuse themselves  and  say  on  a  hard  day yesterday  i  had  a  fight  with  my co-worker  or  my  ex  or and  i  don't  feel  like  doing  the  work well  that's  the  time  to  get  back  on  the horse yeah  because  because  it's  the  it's  all of  those  times  that  we self-correct  those  are  the  most  valuable moments  to  us  people who've  had  profoundly  transcendental experiences  where  they we  say  got  lit  up  they  connected  and their  brain  goes  into very  very  high  coherent  states  and  super gamma  patterns  that  are way  outside  of  normal  and  they  have  a transcendental  download  or connection  that's  mystical  they  look back  at their  entire  life  they  don't  want  to change one  thing  in  their  past  because  it  got them  to  that  moment that's  the  moment  the  past  no  longer exists  now  by  the  same  means they  look  back  at  their  past  and  they see all  those  tough  moments  where  they overcame  themselves  and  they  fall  in love  with  that  person they  don't  look  at  the  good  meditations or  the  things  that  went  well they  look  they  know  that  it  was  those moments  that  got  them  to  this  moment and  i  think  then  that's  when  they  begin to  understand  that that  all  of  the  hard  work  all  the  effort in  who  we  become  makes  no  one  can  take that  away  from  us  so  then once  we  arrive  at  that  level  and  we experience  whatever  the  dream  is  or whatever  we  create the  next  thing  is  do  it  until  you  fully enjoy  it  and  then  when  it  gets  boring  or predictable let's  go  again  let's  do  something  else",
  "in  who  we  become  makes  no  one  can  take that  away  from  us  so  then once  we  arrive  at  that  level  and  we experience  whatever  the  dream  is  or whatever  we  create the  next  thing  is  do  it  until  you  fully enjoy  it  and  then  when  it  gets  boring  or predictable let's  go  again  let's  do  something  else yeah  and  i  think  that's  evolution if  you  want  even  more  videos  just  like this  one click  on  the  boxes  over  here  and  if  you want  to  continue seeing  these  kinds  of  stories  you  can subscribe  by  clicking  the  link right  here"
