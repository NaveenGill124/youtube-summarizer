  "I realized have the career and the life that looks like the dream, but are you really happy, Emma? Are you really healthy? And have to admit to myself that I wasn't was one of the scariest things I've ever had to do. >> The number one health and wellness podcast, >> J Shetty. >> J Shetty, >> the one, the only J. Shetty. >> Emma, welcome to On Purpose. I'm so grateful that you're here and >> you know you've kind of been out of the public eye for a while now. >> Yes. >> And don't do that many interviews. I've watched the interviews you have done even before we plan to do this. And I wanted to ask from an intention point almost of why now? Why today? Why here? >> I think I mentioned but I read your book um because my my dear friend Nuper told me that I should and every now and again I would see you come up on my feed. I don't spend much time on Instagram anymore, but when I did, I just felt like you were having a different conversation. And it's not that I have stopped doing interviews",
  "told me that I should and every now and again I would see you come up on my feed. I don't spend much time on Instagram anymore, but when I did, I just felt like you were having a different conversation. And it's not that I have stopped doing interviews because I want to hide myself away. I think it's because I wanted to be able to have a certain type of conversation that I didn't seem able to find a space for. And so I called Nooper and said, \"I think I just reached out to Jay to see if you would let me come and do his podcast on Monday.\" And she was like, \"I've been waiting for this. I wondered when you would do this.\" I was like, \"How did you know I was going to do it?\" She's like, \"I don't know. I just felt like this was coming.\" So, um, here I am. And you said yes and the timing worked. I I contacted you last week and it's Monday and so >> well from Well, that means the world to me. Truly. I'm so grateful for that because the few interactions and conversations we've",
  "this was coming.\" So, um, here I am. And you said yes and the timing worked. I I contacted you last week and it's Monday and so >> well from Well, that means the world to me. Truly. I'm so grateful for that because the few interactions and conversations we've had since then and you've sent me a few things to read over whether it's journals or reflections and honestly I I think I just said it to you a few moments ago and I mean it even if we weren't having this conversation today and you just sent me those things to reflect on myself that would have already been a gift and so the opportunity to actually sit with you and to talk about these things and have the space to have a conversation that you feel you haven't had before means the world to me and so thank you for trusting me and it's I I look forward to getting to know you so much better. But let's let's dive in. I want I wanted to start by asking you like you said something there that was really beautiful because you stopped for a moment then you",
  "thank you for trusting me and it's I I look forward to getting to know you so much better. But let's let's dive in. I want I wanted to start by asking you like you said something there that was really beautiful because you stopped for a moment then you said it's easier to be honest >> and and I was wanted to understand what that what that meant to you and how that feels. Such a big part of my job was trying to think three steps ahead of how everything that I would say would be could negatively impact the film that I was trying to do justice to and do service to and make sure that people understood what the director had intended and I felt this enormous sense of responsibility all the time to honor so many people's work that put together something like a film or you know even to some degree. I just did a fragrance with Prada and it's the first perfume bottle that you can like refill and I don't know I I take my job seriously I guess and so interviews to me felt a lot like chess and it required",
  "or you know even to some degree. I just did a fragrance with Prada and it's the first perfume bottle that you can like refill and I don't know I I take my job seriously I guess and so interviews to me felt a lot like chess and it required so much energy and I think what's nice about the way that I'm showing up today is I'm just showing up for myself and for once. I actually am not here to um speak on behalf of anyone else or anything else other than myself, which is unusual. >> Yeah. I think I think it's such a fascinating thing because as a viewer, even before I got closer to the industry, >> as a viewer, everything's made to feel in traditional media so easy and it has levity and it feels like you're getting someone's real personality and and then you realize that you are. There's definitely reality to it and truth to it. >> Yes. >> But at the same time, naturally, it's work. >> Yeah. >> And and there's a job. And I think it's not as >> And you can shed more light on this. I don't",
  "you realize that you are. There's definitely reality to it and truth to it. >> Yes. >> But at the same time, naturally, it's work. >> Yeah. >> And and there's a job. And I think it's not as >> And you can shed more light on this. I don't think it's always as insidious or as dark as people may think it is, but there's there's just it's a job and it's work and there's results that matter, >> right? >> 100%. And I think within those contexts, everyone is trying to be as authentic as they humanly can be. But there's something about I think it's why I mentioned um earlier about why I felt like this was a good space is there's something inherently written into certain types of forms of media which is that it it doesn't matter what intention or or how authentically you want to show up the form like somehow doesn't allow it >> to some degree and I've become obsessed with this recently. I've been looking at okay what is written into the form of something like Twitter or Instagram or Tik Tok or a podcast versus or a photograph versus a",
  "to show up the form like somehow doesn't allow it >> to some degree and I've become obsessed with this recently. I've been looking at okay what is written into the form of something like Twitter or Instagram or Tik Tok or a podcast versus or a photograph versus a film versus a piece of writing and it's really interesting to see what a different medium or different form allows or doesn't allow and or like actually creates or encourages. I've never done a podcast before, but I love I think what I love about it is the is the intimacy of it. It's like I feel like people listen to podcasts when they're like I certainly do anyway like first thing in the morning when I'm taking my shower or I'm going on my walk or I'm making my breakfast. It's really like personal intimate time and I think the long form version of these kinds of conversations uh allows for such a different kind of discussion that I don't think was possible before. >> Yeah, absolutely. I couldn't agree with you more. I was going to ask you actually because I want everyone to get up to date",
  "the long form version of these kinds of conversations uh allows for such a different kind of discussion that I don't think was possible before. >> Yeah, absolutely. I couldn't agree with you more. I was going to ask you actually because I want everyone to get up to date with where you are now. Like what is what does your day-to-day life look like? You just said like I wake up and I shower and I go on a walk. Like what does your day-to-day life look like right now? And what what makes what's it made of and what are the things that you love and look forward to? >> I recently started riding a bicycle and yes, I started riding a bicycle before my driving van, but now it's particularly fortuitous that I also ride a bicycle um for that reason. But >> I thought that was mainstream news. >> Yeah. Oh my god. I was getting phone calls like it's on the BBC. It's on international worldwide news. I was like my shame is that it's everywhere. This is I mean what I say it's I don't know. I think in a funny way what the",
  "mainstream news. >> Yeah. Oh my god. I was getting phone calls like it's on the BBC. It's on international worldwide news. I was like my shame is that it's everywhere. This is I mean what I say it's I don't know. I think in a funny way what the sweetest result of it was getting so many messages from being people being like happened to me too. I feel you. This is awful. It sucks. Um which was kind of nice in a way but um >> lift. >> Yeah totally. Do you need a lift? It's like actually yes. But I think again it's funny like I I went from when you work on movies I don't know if people know this but like they literally will not insure you to drive yourself to work. I've asked so many times. >> You have to be driven. >> You have to be driven. It's like not a choice. And especially because they need you there, you know, down to the minute basically depending on what they have going on. And so I went from basically only driving myself on weekends or during holiday to then when I became a",
  "have to be driven. It's like not a choice. And especially because they need you there, you know, down to the minute basically depending on what they have going on. And so I went from basically only driving myself on weekends or during holiday to then when I became a student driving myself all the time and yeah I did not have the experience or skills uh clearly which I now will and and and do. But I think again this was one of these like awkward transitions I made from kind of living this like very very structured life to living a life where I was like okay I guess I'm going to get myself to this place and I'm going to like do this thing that I've basically not done since I was 10 years old. So, it's been a discovery and a journey that's been um yeah, I guess humbling because on a movie set, I'm able to do all of these like extremely complex things, stunt, sing, dance, like do this thing, do that, whatever. And I'm like, \"Yep, don't worry about it, guys. No worries. I've got you.\" And then I get home and I'm",

Like you you don't seem able to do some pretty like basic life things. And it it was definitely kind of Yeah, I had days where I just wanted to turn around to people and be like, I used to be good at things. Okay. I used to be really good at things. And I know it doesn't look like that right now, but um I I used to I I can do things normally. Um, so yeah, it's been uh it's been humbling. >> I feel I feel like all of us I feel like all of us can relate to that though because doesn't everyone forget their keys, their wallet, doesn't know where things are?

I appreciate that so much. >> Because I was in the States for I've been in the States now for 9 years and I think it happened just but then all the points get wiped off. >> Wow. And I think I'm now back to six points. I spent two months in London a year. >> Okay. Every time I go back, I seem to >> Oh, much better. Wow. >> So, I'm confessing to you. >> But I haven't lost it. >> A lot of people actually a lot of people have like taken it upon themselves to come and confess to me, which I found like very like very endearing and like really really appreciate it.

  "Wow. >> So, I'm confessing to you. >> But I haven't lost it. >> A lot of people actually a lot of people have like taken it upon themselves to come and confess to me, which I found like very like very endearing and like really really appreciate it. But no, I think, you know, I think something I've been realizing is we most of us live in a state of like I'm just trying to kind of figure it out and keep it together. And the only thing that is different between us is people's willingness to be honest about that. The degree to which they can admit to actually I'm just like scrabbling around trying to keep the pieces together versus um oh yeah I know everything's amazing and everything's incredible and I'm having the best day ever and aren't you? And you know, so I do love the people who who are just willing to be like, \"Yeah, it's uh it's not going so well today.\" I'm like, \"Great, amazing. What a good starting point.\" Like I don't know, failure as a starting point. Feels like I feel like attempting things is so compelling. And >> of",

What a good starting point.\" Like I don't know, failure as a starting point. Feels like I feel like attempting things is so compelling. And >> of course success is wonderful, but I love to see people who are like, \"I'm really bad at this, but I'm going to try.\" like I love you. That's everything to me. Everything. >> And that seems to be becoming harder and harder now. >> Like that desire to attempt something that you might not be good at because it's exposed or because everyone will see it or because everyone will hear about it. >> Talking about attempting things. I mean, you're currently studying, right? You're learning. >> Yes. Yes. Well, two things I want to say there is I think in a way I was sort of I mean I'm someone who's always cared about vulnerability and authenticity, but I think I was also forced into it to a degree that that maybe even I wasn't ready for and that like I just started so young that like I had",
  "in a way I was sort of I mean I'm someone who's always cared about vulnerability and authenticity, but I think I was also forced into it to a degree that that maybe even I wasn't ready for and that like I just started so young that like I had to learn in public. I had to make mistakes in public and say, \"Oh, okay. Now I've learned this.\" And I had to be willing to go back and be like, hm, like there was some gaps here. Um, and here's what I know now. And I think people's I agree with you. I think it's becoming increasingly difficult to learn in public and continuing to learn. I mean, I think that's one of the reasons why I I have gone back to school and why I continue to do it is because I want to make sure that I have things to say that are worth saying. And I think you can only do that if you take a minute sometimes and listen to some people who aren't you, you know, like not just the sound of my own my own wonderful voice. Um, so yeah, it's been it's",
  "have things to say that are worth saying. And I think you can only do that if you take a minute sometimes and listen to some people who aren't you, you know, like not just the sound of my own my own wonderful voice. Um, so yeah, it's been it's been great. And I think also I needed to I wanted to be inspired. I think being around my favorite piece has been being around young people who still believe that the world is malleable and things are changeable and that like anything can be done is um such important energy. There's so much dystopian fiction at the moment and dystopian movies so dark. >> It's so dark and I'm just like >> what happened to thinking about the utopia? What happened to like planning for the best case scenario? like where where did we lose yeah vision excitement imagination possibility so I think it's been um yeah it's been wonderful to be around young people and just to sit there and listen >> do you ever I mean you clearly read so much do you have to take yourself away to do it in order to be able to",
  "possibility so I think it's been um yeah it's been wonderful to be around young people and just to sit there and listen >> do you ever I mean you clearly read so much do you have to take yourself away to do it in order to be able to do it do you have to cordon off time like how are you still managing to study and learn because that seems like it's important to you Yeah. You you reminded me as you were talking of one of my spiritual teachers, my monk teacher, who always said to me, if you want to move three steps forward, you have to go three steps deep first. >> Whoa. >> And what I found often in my life is I'm trying to go four steps forward and I haven't yet gone four steps deep. And so it's almost like I mean this is probably a a terrible analogy, but maybe thinking of the movie The Substance. I don't know if you watched it. >> Okay, fine. Okay. Terrible. Let's let's remove No, no, no. Let's forget about it. But but it's that idea of like every extra step you take when",
  "this is probably a a terrible analogy, but maybe thinking of the movie The Substance. I don't know if you watched it. >> Okay, fine. Okay. Terrible. Let's let's remove No, no, no. Let's forget about it. But but it's that idea of like every extra step you take when you haven't learned and you haven't experimented and you haven't attempted >> is taking away from your ability to move forward. And sometimes I think when we feel stuck or when we think things are not moving or they're not progressing. >> You may be a sign to say well pause and go deeper for a second or pause and go inward for a second. And so to me, hearing that from you, I I find that and and I'm I definitely fail at this all the time. >> There are so many times I'm trying to push more forward than I've gone deep. >> And so whenever I notice that myself and I notice that I'm just kind of trying everything and nothing is working, it's actually just the universe and self saying to me, go read, go study. And so I found that I've had to really carve",
  "than I've gone deep. >> And so whenever I notice that myself and I notice that I'm just kind of trying everything and nothing is working, it's actually just the universe and self saying to me, go read, go study. And so I found that I've had to really carve out time to make time to do what I love, which is to read and study. But I found that I'm someone who doesn't love 30 minutes a day. I'm not that kind of a reader. I'm someone who needs to read for 3 or 4 hours, if not more. And so I found that carving out deep immersive time is more important to me than this kind of mechanical 30 40 minutes a day, which is great for you if that works for you as a habit. It doesn't bit of an extremist and I just need to spend a whole weekend reading >> as opposed to I don't need to read every day. So I'll try and I try once a month on a weekend to just absorb into a subject that I love and I'll take a course, I'll go to a class, I'll watch a TED",
  "a whole weekend reading >> as opposed to I don't need to read every day. So I'll try and I try once a month on a weekend to just absorb into a subject that I love and I'll take a course, I'll go to a class, I'll watch a TED talk online, I'll read as many books as I can and I try and immerse myself that way. What's your learning style? I'm the same as you. And actually u someone who I really respect and ask for advice for often and I ask for feedback on on myself. He said to me, Emma, I think if you did 90% of what you wanted to do at 50% of the speed, you would get so much more like life would be so much better. And I was like, \"Wow, 50% of the speed and only 90% of what I want to do.\" And he was like, I think that's the minimum to be honest. And I was like, wow. But I think it, yeah, what you said resonates. I think I often have to remind myself that it's not about speedily getting somewhere. It's just not the point. Things are",

I think I often have to remind myself that it's not about speedily getting somewhere. It's just not the point. Things are supposed to happen um with a certain timing. And so um yeah, resonates. And and to your point, I cannot just sit for 30 minutes and look at something. I need I need kind of like a week on holiday and then I'll start to deeply get into something and I need quiet and I hyperfocus and I that's when I you know I love it but I can't I can't do little itty bitty bits. It drives me nuts. >> It just doesn't work for me. >> It doesn't work. So it doesn't work for me. Resates. >> You said that you felt that you had to learn in public and then you made mistakes. Like what were mistakes that felt like mistakes then >> that made you feel like oh gosh I made that mistake in public but I was 10 years old or whatever it was >>",
  "said that you felt that you had to learn in public and then you made mistakes. Like what were mistakes that felt like mistakes then >> that made you feel like oh gosh I made that mistake in public but I was 10 years old or whatever it was >> and now you look back and you think oh you know I was able to process it. >> Yeah. I I think the big one was feminism and intersectional feminism and frankly it just like wasn't taught. you know, I had to really seek out and I'm really grateful actually that I was in many ways quite lovingly called in as opposed to I mean some of it was not but I think that was definitely a moment where I had to say okay I'm talking about something really big and important and it's actually really important to sit this in some context which I have not done and I think that was a big moment. I think it was more there was an omission that was there was things that were missing as opposed to I had said something wrong. I just needed I just needed to fill in",
  "in some context which I have not done and I think that was a big moment. I think it was more there was an omission that was there was things that were missing as opposed to I had said something wrong. I just needed I just needed to fill in more gaps. And so um that was when I started or that was actually in the middle. I had a I had a feminist book club called Art Shad Shelf. >> And um so that was part of those conversations. But it was a good moment for me to learn that feeling uncomfortable sometimes is good. I think we have an alarm system that goes off which is like I'm uncomfortable. This feels uncomfortable. So something bad must be happening and I must leave as soon as possible. And actually I think that was when I started to learn, oh actually me being uncomfortable in a space um might be a good sign because it might mean I'm about to learn something. And I want to attribute this that was Mara Larasai who who helped me understand that and uh was a very very valuable teaching. So now when I'm",
  "actually me being uncomfortable in a space um might be a good sign because it might mean I'm about to learn something. And I want to attribute this that was Mara Larasai who who helped me understand that and uh was a very very valuable teaching. So now when I'm in a space and listening to things and I feel uncomfortable I don't think it means I need to bolt or something bad's happening. >> Yeah. >> Maybe something really good is about to happen. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. And I feel like that goes back to what we started with this idea of attempting means discomfort >> and attempting means incomplete. >> Yeah. >> In that and I love I love that point you made that actually whenever we're sharing anything it's not that it's not true. It's that it's not complete. >> Yes. >> And mostly when we see people say things or >> share ideas, it's very rare to have anyone ever share a complete idea because that means they would have had to think about it from every single vantage point. Yeah. which is not even humanly possible. >> It's not possible. It's not possible. And",

Yeah. which is not even humanly possible. >> It's not possible. It's not possible. And I think Adrien Marie Brown, I don't know if you've ever had, she's she wrote an amazing book which um is one of her more recent ones which is called Loving Corrections. and she speaks to kind of exactly this, which is there's kind of this like that we see online when people don't attribute something perfectly to someone else or they're missing something and it's like, isn't the whole point of this that we're in conversation? And if it's the right person, you can see that a good intention is there, >> then maybe we can kind of do it in a way that doesn't need to be I mean obviously there's there's important time and place for holding people accountable. >> Um but maybe I don't know attributing like great we're all going to help each other kind of pad this out fill this out. >> Yeah. >>",

Yeah. It's it's a hard I think that's the hard part. It's like how do you differentiate between holding someone accountable >> and giving them grace? And that's a really interesting discussion in and of itself. And I don't think I I have the answer or know exactly what it is, but I feel like that's a thought exercise as humans that if we were to do it would actually I don't know. What's your take? >> Maybe the grace is attributing good intention and the accountability is the courage it takes to actually say something to someone. because it's such a scary thing to do and it often requires a lot of emotional labor >> and I find this a lot as a woman when I'm especially as a woman who's dating that like I I will just be like is it worth me explaining is it worth",
  "it's such a scary thing to do and it often requires a lot of emotional labor >> and I find this a lot as a woman when I'm especially as a woman who's dating that like I I will just be like is it worth me explaining is it worth me explaining this thing or should I just not take the time to do this because sometimes I will really I care about doing it kindly and compassionately. And it's very rare for me to attribute bad intent to anyone, but you know, sometimes it does fall on on deaf ears and you're like that text message took me like 40 minutes like to word perfectly or that voice note or whatever and you're like is this making a difference? Like am I getting through to any is transformative justice real? Like is this is this label worth it? But I think I don't have a perfect answer. I I I'm not I haven't lived through enough of it to know. I guess I've just reached a point where it's like I'd rather I'd rather die trying. I'd rather die having tried.

And maybe some small piece of it, even if it's not now, even if it's at some future point, like something I've said just like goes, \"Oh, something at the back of my mind here, someone says something to me, then you know, maybe it's worth it.\" >> Yeah. I will never believe that one negates the other and that my experience of that person I don't get to keep and cherish. I to come back to our earlier thing like I just don't think these things are either or. I hope people who don't agree with my opinion will love me and I hope I can keep loving people who I don't necessarily share the same opinion with. And I think that's a very very important way for me that I need to be able to move through life. I really do believe in having conversations. And I guess where I've landed is it's not so much",
  "loving people who I don't necessarily share the same opinion with. And I think that's a very very important way for me that I need to be able to move through life. I really do believe in having conversations. And I guess where I've landed is it's not so much what we say or what we believe, but very often how we say it. When you think about Little Emma, >> Yes. >> like what was a childhood memory that you have, a core memory that you have that you feel has defined who you are today somewhat? >> I think I won't share the specific memory cuz it's so personal, but I think I've always felt other people's pain very intensely. M >> um until maybe recently, I did not know how to give myself grace and navigate seeing my sensitivity as a strength and knowing that it's like my gift, but it also means I have to care for it in specific specific ways.

  "my gift, but it also means I have to care for it in specific specific ways. When you are given gifts, there's often kind of have to compensate in some other ways. And in the same way that like my position in life and fame has given me this extraordinary power, it's also given me a lot of responsibility. And these things often have these kind of I don't know when or why it started, but I think I've always whoever it was that was suffering in the room, I was always the most aware of them. >> And I think that has formed a lot of why I could act. It was almost like I was kind of sucking all of this in and then I needed to let it out somewhere or unleash it somewhere. And I remember when my parents saw me on stage for the first time afterwards, they were just like, \"Where did that come from? You don't have any of these experiences.\" I recorded a song for my 12th birthday. My mom bought me a day in a recording studio. And I sing Natalie and Bruy is torn. Like I've had my heart broken",

And I'm 12 and I've never had a boyfriend and I don't know anything about love. Have you ever thought about where it came from or >> I would imagine I I can't say for sure. I would imagine that my family structure has not been a traditional family structure. And that feeling of knowing that I'm from a situation where we just don't quite fit the kind of nuclear family mold. And I think coming back from France and trying to figure out how to sort of integrate and being the eldest and having my younger brother and having my mom and like trying to sort of be some sort of glue or holding together for everyone's feelings. >> I'm pretty sure that's probably where it >> that's where it started. >> Yeah.

I think it's also why I've had to really navigate my relationship towards art and acting because I'm pretty sure that I was using acting as a way of escaping how painful um my parents like it wasn't just the divorce. It was just like the continuing situation of living between two different houses and two different lives and two different sets of values. And as a child like being aware of like hm we don't quite have the support we need here for this like this is not quite we're not quite like and I think it does it makes you it made me a slightly serious child because I was like had that consciousness and then when I would go and spend the weekend with my dad it was like a very different set of rules, very different situation and so you do you kind of",

And the hard part of that was that no one gave me any easy answers. >> It meant I had to form all of my own opinions myself because there was no consensus. >> And it made me a critical thinker for sure because >> and so that was amazing and also really like gosh, okay, I need to decide what I think is important in life and what my opinions are.

Like if you're living a reality one way but presenting something else, those are the moments when it can it can you can really feel torn apart. And I I recognized that and I didn't want that to be my life. I didn't want pretend to be my real life. >> Yeah.

And it it's fascinating to me to look at that. for you, you were acting in school plays since you were a a young girl. >> And was acting always something you were going to do, or did do you feel like it was this cross-section of what was happening in your personal life that actually made that feel like the direction you would choose? >> I think it's so interesting",

I did a poetry competition when I was nine called the Daisy Pratt poetry competition. And I'm actually naturally quite a shy person. Uh and so actually for me to stand up in front of people feels like an out-of- body experience. Like there's so much adrenaline coursing through my veins that it does feel like a moment outside of time. And I remember the exhilaration of living the kind of ups and downs of this poem.

And I also did it as a way of getting to feel free for a moment of of what I was like the discomfort of that time of not quite knowing who I was or how to be in the world. And as I've become more healed and whole and and more comfortable being myself, it's been interesting to ask myself, do you still need acting? do you still need to act? Like why what are you doing that for? And like the kind of it used to feel like almost like a compulsion that I needed to do it. And what's really interesting now is I don't feel quite that kind of urgency of needing to do it.

I realized I was drawing on painful stuff in my life that I was actually healing and I didn't want to keep revisiting in order to do some of the more intense, scarier, sadder things that I had to do. I realized I remember by Beth's um deathbed by her by her graveside when we shot those films. Like normally there are like these painful memories that I would use for those moments. And I realized I was like I don't know if this is super great for me actually to keep to keep revisiting these or if I want to use these as my tools and I don't think that means I'll never come back to acting. I think it just meant I was like hm I wonder if there's a different way to do this. Mhm. >> I think the second thing was to be really honest.

I was coming to those sets with an expectation that I think I had developed on Harry Potter, which was that we were the people I worked with were going to be my family and that we were going to be lifelong friends. I came to work looking for friendship and that was a very painful experience for me outside of Harry Potter and in Hollywood. like bonebreakingly painful. Um because most people don't come to those environments looking for friendships. They're looking for this is my chance. This is my role. This is what I want out of it. I'm focused. This is my job. This is my career. Like let's go. And I was not of that mindset. And so I found I found the rejection really painful. >> The friendship rejection. Yeah. >> Yeah.

Maybe I just wasn't built for those kinds of highly competitive environments. It Yeah, it broke me. Yeah. But in a way, I'm proud that it did because I guess that means I have something left to break. I have a heart left to break. So, it was a hard learning, but I think there's something that I'm proud of in a way that there were certain things I couldn't withstand.

Um, but I think it's just I think I just used to completely sacrifice myself for whatever the thing was I was trying to achieve. And that could be a grade, it could be a movie, it could be promoting. I just was obsessed with excellence and doing everything, giving my all to everything and doing it to the best of my ability. And unless you have the right people around you that can hold that kind of level of commitment, you're going to get smashed up. You're just going to get crushed.

And I think understanding that makeup of myself and not punishing myself for that, but just knowing it needs certain kinds of conditions is how I've come to hopefully I'll keep doing it forever and probably every day, but accepting myself. Yeah, it seems like I' I've spoken to so many and we were talking about this last week when we were when we were speaking on the phone that I I've worked with so many young people, musicians who who've all been told like, \"All right, if you don't do this over the next 12 months, you're not going to make it.\" >> Yeah. >> Or like if you don't do this right now, if you don't say yes to this song or this movie, it's",

I think it's just like understanding that no one at the end of the day is going to be in the room like when you're actually doing the thing. You have to carry that moment and you have to carry that pressure. Also, making films, the hours on them are so demanding that to have your own life alongside that, to have that balance is almost impossible. It's so all or nothing. It's so all-encompassing, especially if you're in a lead role. Um, you kind of go through these, you know, working six days a week, 14 to 16 hour days, and then you're just kind of dropped off at the end of it. and maybe you'll have a 2 or 3 month gap and then there's just kind of like nothing. >> And so you're like riding this like incredible peak of like adrenaline and cortisol and then you just get like dropped off the edge and then you're like, \"Okay, wait, now I have",

Or you have to navigate these huge impacts on your nervous system that you need a system and a support system to help you navigate. And I think it's why addiction and mental illness in my profession and in a lot of high stress, high profile professions is so common place because you're trying to balance out these enormous chemical ups and downs. >> Yeah. talk talk to people about why because I think from the outside >> when someone sees a red carpet >> or",

Yes. >> And some people do the red carpet and leave immediately, but but what's going on there?

Like it it just everything in your body says something's wrong. like people are screaming something's wrong. >> But then you have to try to pretend as though >> this is all normal and you're unfased. So you have like two things going on. One, you're like navigating this like sensory overload that's like telling you, oh my god, something is really wrong. >> Telling you how to pose, telling you where to look, telling you >> Yeah. So, so you're trying to navigate, okay, something feels wrong, but I need to also simultaneously make it seem as though I am the most graceful and the most calm I've ever been in my whole life.

  "I need to also simultaneously make it seem as though I am the most graceful and the most calm I've ever been in my whole life.

And I probably would have had four different notes from the stylist about how I'm supposed to stand and what I need to do for the dress. And then I've got like 25 different talking points from the movie of like what I need to get across and also avoid saying or talking about. And so like you need to be thinking about that. And the the juggle is crazy. And then I think everyone is in this like kind of jumped up state. And so like trying to have a normal conversation with anyone is basically impossible because you feel like an insane person. And so these are not environments in which you like have a nice chat with someone really.

Well, not not in a mean way. I don't but like you know you always get asked when you're like promoting these big films like so do you guys hang out on set and like do you guys hang out and like are you all friends and everyone sort of like nods enthusiastically but the truth is no one has seen each other outside of work like very very very rarely mostly because the schedule is insane.

They they can and they like do occasionally but it it's more of a more of a you know solar eclipse than a than an everyday situation. So yeah, but you have to pretend. I think that's the part that starts to feel icky after a while is like you you have to pretend that you're all best friends. And what's so sad and and I I know this isn't just the case for me, but like I think people wish they were. >> I think we wish we did have those real connections and we did have that real support.

I remember I brought I think maybe like seven different Beanie Babies with me along and like all these different like lucky talismans and I loved the world and the books so much.

I mean, it would have been considerably easier if I had not continued going to school. Um, but she, wow, like I will forever be in her debt.

He he said to me, he goes, \"Jay, you're really lucky because he goes, \"When people stop me, they stop me for who I play to be. >> And when they stop you, they stop you for who you are.\" And it was really encouraging words from someone that I respect a lot. >> And I was like, \"Wow.\" Like, I never thought about it like that.

And it was that conversation that made me even be even more personal with everyone that I ever spoke to because they'd always have a personal story or and and that's not not to say that isn't true for music and for acting and of course there is. I don't want to take away from it. >> No. No. >> Um and I'm not saying that as a egotistical statement. I'm saying it as like how hard it is for an individual to go through that. >> Yes. >> And to be disassociated from themselves. >> Yes. Uh because that role could be a part of you. It could be an expression of you. It was a part of your life at a certain period of time, but of course it isn't you. >> Yes. >> Um but does that make any sense? >> I remember when I gave my UN speech about he for she and about feminism and women's rights and people started stopping me because of things that I had come from me and that I had said.

  "any sense? >> I remember when I gave my UN speech about he for she and about feminism and women's rights and people started stopping me because of things that I had come from me and that I had said. It felt like a very significant transition for me because I for the first time I felt like I could look someone in the eye and receive and accept something that they were saying because I I felt like it actually had something to do with me and I wasn't just kind of a like a custodian of something sacred which I did take very seriously and I still do but it had been a direct transmission from me and I think that's why writing has become so important to me is because it's a way that I say things directly and that feels really meaningful. Yeah, I love I love the word you just used there of the difference between being a custodian and you know direct transmission you said and and that's such an interesting way to think about it and I think each and every one of us don't want to be known as a lawyer or",

And no one wants to be that with their friends. And >> no one no one want and and me included, by the way.

Like I I just want to be and and so even for someone who love who is doing direct transmission a lot more of the time even then there's a feeling of well I don't want to say anything profound in this conversation. >> I need to put this down. >> Yeah. I need to put the one down. Right. >> Yes. Yeah. I think a big piece of me like understanding again like why I needed to take a minute is that like even being the person who was promoting the work became a kind of role like Emma Watson became this like avatar this this person that I identified with but also kind of didn't she'd become reproduced so many times over and and kind of had become",
  "minute is that like even being the person who was promoting the work became a kind of role like Emma Watson became this like avatar this this person that I identified with but also kind of didn't she'd become reproduced so many times over and and kind of had become so loaded by all of this different stuff that I she almost felt too heavy to carry. Like I kind of was like I don't even know if I can if I can be that anymore. Like I like you know I went on a date like 2 years ago and like it was the best confession ever. But I was like messaging this person. And they were like, \"Emma,\" and he was like, \"Can I just say something? Like, Emma Watson makes me anxious.\" And I was like, \"Emma Watson makes me anxious, too. That's so good.\" Are on the same page. Like, I get it. Like, >> I I can't even be her. I I don't know how to be her. Live up to to what I look like on the cover of a magazine. I don't look like that. Like, I I can't I don't know. I",

Like, I I can't I don't know. I don't even know how to touch what that person's become. That was kind of a funny realization at some point where I was like, I really need to step off this thing cuz I just once you've I don't know there's such a glamorization that comes hand inhand with being a public famous person, especially if you're a woman, like I feel I feel so envious of my male co-stars who can just put on a t-shirt and show up without like this like whole rigma roll of kind of becoming being acceptable enough to be on camera and like kudos to Pamela Anderson recently just like doing the thing because it's like the amount of courage it will have taken to do that like I cannot even begin to express to you it's wild the the expectations are insane it's impossible so >> short on vacation >> private space",

So, it's like you're on this constantly like I don't know, it's like a some sort of like like Survivors Island game show beauty nightmare where you know, I don't know. It's it's it's nuts. So I Yeah, I think part of also not feeling like Emma Watson is just like the whole like glam squad culture of of it all is it's intense. It's yeah it's so fascinating because there's almost like this this learning of becoming >> you know becoming Emma Watson becoming you know being all the roles you play and then it almost feels like what you're saying is there was a moment you wanted to step off and unlearn what that meant. >> Totally. >> But that seems really hard. >> Yes. >>",

Does it ever start to feel like you're like, \"Wow, this is a lot.\" People ask me all the time, \"Do you ever wonder why people want to hang out with you or be your friend or whatever?\" And does that ever get complicated for you? >> I think because my direct transmission is so clear, >> that if anyone in the industry wants to connect, >> Yeah. there's usually quite a distinct journey that they're on >> that mine can support or help with as a friend or in in a more formal capacity and >> that I deeply enjoy and",

Yeah, they're not. Yeah. They don't think I'm fun enough. Yeah. I just I just saw I just saw a clip of the other day of Austin Butler saying he's he's he does he's never been invited to a bachelor party before and I was like I couldn't believe it.

And so sometimes I think it's a good my direct transmission is a good protective mechanism because I don't really get asked to come to things but then at the same time it takes me to get to know someone deeply. Like I just traveled with a friend uh to Greece and we played and I don't think they were anticipating this but we played three nights of poker from midnight to 7:00 a.m. and it was amazing and I loved it and I had the best time and I don't think they expected me to do that. They expect me to get to bed early but I was on vacation and I was like game. Yeah, exactly. and I won. So I was like, you know, I'll take it. And I'm very competitive in that way and I enjoy it.

And that can feel really dehumanizing and sometimes quite kind of seeing someone's like behavior like completely switch and turn and change can be kind of a jarring experience. I think what's nice is at the very least like dating for everyone is a is a basically a complete disaster and free-for-all. So, like I feel like I'm in good company in that sense. But I think it's funny occasionally people will apologize to me for the fact they've not seen my films and I will be like please don't apologize.

I'm so incredibly relieved.\" >> And then you realize they have the box that later on. >> Yeah. No. I'm like, \"God, I hope not.\" But I mean, I guess like I want people to appreciate my work, but I think knowing you don't have to navigate that extra like degree of weirdness is uh helpful, a relief.

Yeah. >> Did it again. E >> it got a distinction. >> Oh, amazing. Great. There we go. I love it. It actually did.

And what I've realized is >> I'm now at a place where I've given myself permission to be all of myself, >> even if others don't give me permission to be all of those things. >> Yes. >> Because Yeah. And how amazing to get to that point where I realized for a long time I was pushing for I need everyone to understand me and I need them to understand these decisions and I need them to understand that I'm all of these things. And I'm like but do you really Emma? Do you actually really need them to get it or is it enough that you get it? You see it and understand it and you're making it possible and giving yourself permission to do that.

Um, how do I see love today? Oh, okay. I think I have an answer for this. How exciting. I was right there for I was like to say, God, I hope I do. Am I that deep? Yeah. Okay. So, um I think that h we don't talk about love nearly enough or I think we need to talk about it so much more because I had such a not a misunderstanding but I think I had a very limited understanding of it for a long time which was that we see in Disney movies and in Hollywood movies this idea that like falling in love once it's sort of happened to you it's like irreversible you know like step into this portal",
  "I think I had a very limited understanding of it for a long time which was that we see in Disney movies and in Hollywood movies this idea that like falling in love once it's sort of happened to you it's like irreversible you know like step into this portal that you can't get out of anymore because you've fallen in love. And actually, I I think falling in love might be quite easy to do in some ways. That's sort of the easy bit. The hard part is finding someone who actually wants to be in a dance with you and be in some form of partnership with you. And things like, can you argue? Well, can you be is the conflict that you have generative? And can you make someone else feel safe? Like, and when I say safe, I don't mean like out of physical danger. I mean like, can you either respond to a text message quickly enough that doesn't send the other person into like a complete freef fall and or not pelt them with so many that they feel completely overwhelmed and flooded.

And like there's like that constant back and forth and that constant check-in is like a a game of um check-in in a way of like can you find someone who's willing to be as vulnerable as it necessarily requires I think to like figure out those micro adjustments until you're sort of in some kind of dance with someone else. And that is a very different understanding that I have come to of what love is than I had.

I really, really do. >> What do you think love is, Jay? >> Oh, wow. Oh my gosh. You're flipping this back, Emma. This is about you. It's not about >> This is a conversation. >> I know. I just >> Well, does any of what I've said resonate? >> It does. It does. It resonates a lot. >> I'm on the right track, Jay. I need you to tell me. >> I think it resonates a lot.

Like I love that version of love. >> I love the idea that >> love was this really romantic, really sweet >> writing letters every day kind of love. Like that that's the love I dreamed of and love I thought of as a kid at least. >> Yeah. And then, you know, I think I realized that you do all of that with the first person you're with in your teens and and you kind of think it's the real thing, but then they're in a mood every night for no reason and you're just people pleasing and trying to figure out what's going on and you think it's all about making that person happy and so you mold and you bend and you, >> you know, sabotage parts of yourself. And I realized very quickly that >> that wasn't love.

The first is she doesn't subscribe to any of the movie Disney versions of Love. >> Wow. At all. >> Oh my god. What education did she have? Where can I get it? >> Yeah. Literally. And and the other part is that I think she's the only person I've ever loved enough to be taught by. >> Oh my god. >> Which is like a really interesting part of love that I think's missed.

She she also taught me how to love me for who I was and not what I had. Because I think >> a lot of men go through this, at least men that I'm friends with and that I've spoken to, that >> we want people to respect us for our success. >> Yes. >> And rever us for our accomplishments.

It's how men have been adored since the beginning of time for going out and getting the food or going out there and winning the battle or conquering a nation. And that's what you were known for. And so my wife's been with me since before my career took off and I had any success. And I think as I gained success, I think my immaturity was to want her to love me for that more.

And she didn't do it in a rejecting way or in a >> in a it just didn't make a difference to her. >> This isn't why I love you.

And I think that's the point that I think I would have if I had met someone else, I would have valued myself for very different reasons. and knowing you're with someone who truly is with you because of who you are and your character and that's what they honor. >> And and I think that word honor and respect probably the last thing I'd say I think we always say like love is respect and based on respect but >> I wrote a list of things that I >> I tried to be clear with myself about what it is I was really looking for and I really want and one is someone that I can learn from.

  "respect and based on respect but >> I wrote a list of things that I >> I tried to be clear with myself about what it is I was really looking for and I really want and one is someone that I can learn from.

But the other thing is I think it's why I'm so obsessed with the musical musical Hamilton and why so many people have been. Like maybe this is it's so funny that we're on on the purpose podcast, but like are you with someone who cuz obviously what you have with someone is is wonderful, right?

Like what you two share together, but if you can be in service of a vision that you both share or at the very least are you willing to honor and give dignity to the work of the other person and whatever their vision or mission is in this world. That to me seems far more sustainable than anything else. And so I guess my big hope or wish would be that I met someone who feels like what I want to do in the world. Yes, that I'm important, but they also feel that what I'm here to do is important to them, too. And in some way intersects with what they're here to do. >> I couldn't agree more. It's exactly what I was going to say. >> Is it? >> Yeah. that that I think the word respect and relationship is thrown around a lot but this is the deepest form of respect where there's a famous quote that I don't know who said it but there's a and I would you know you could take the genders out of it now but there's a famous quote that says men marry women hoping they'll never",

And I've I've talked about this often where my wife and I I do this exercise with couples when I'm working with them, but I've also done it in our relationship.

I might never be worthy of it. I hope it happens to me, but like I don't feel entitled to it. like it will either be part of my purpose here and my destiny or it won't. And I think the way we treat it as though well why haven't you and this is something that has to happen in this certain time span and at this certain age in this kind of way is like the least romantic thing I can possibly think of.

I didn't have a clear enough idea of what my purpose, my vision, like how I was going to be of service. I didn't know where I really felt like I needed to be. I think I have some of those answers now. So when I meet someone, I can say, \"Hi, I'm Emma. This is what I care about. This is where the people I love the most live. This is where it's meaningful for me to be in the world.\" And then they can decide whether they can see that there's a way that I can serve what they're trying to do and they can serve what I'm trying to do.

And I think it's such a violence and it's such a cruelty on people and especially young people I think to make and especially women to make them feel like they have no worth or like they haven't succeeded yet in life because they haven't forced to its culmination something that I just don't think can or should ever be forced.

It's but I certainly made a decision to to take time to figure out to not know and to you know I had like this whole disassembling the structure that's needed to carry the loads. And it's like there's an agent and a publicist and a manager and a a personal assistant and there's all these people and lives who are intertwined with mine and navigating and caring for and negotiating that with people as well was like was really tricky and also I was just bloody terrified. Like I think there's a kind of infantilization that can happen when you work as much as I did and a kind of loss of independence that means that you're like, \"Oh my",
  "that with people as well was like was really tricky and also I was just bloody terrified. Like I think there's a kind of infantilization that can happen when you work as much as I did and a kind of loss of independence that means that you're like, \"Oh my god, can I even do my life if I don't have this like army of people who are like helping me do the most menial and basic of things? Like can I actually like do this stuff myself?\" And and I don't even say that in terms of like capability, but like just from the place of like it's difficult for me to walk down the street sometimes. So if I'm going to start to take on truly the responsibility of most of my life myself, like what's that going to be like? Like can I really do that stuff? I think fame makes you feel like you can't do things for yourself in a way that can really disempower you and and remove your confidence and autonomy as a human being.

She booked this podcast herself. >> There was no booker. There was no booking system. There was no There was no reach out. >> No, >> it was literally Emma doing it herself, which is proof you are living your values. >> Thank you. >> And and you are aligned with what you're saying.

I'd love to tell you that it was like this incredible courage and determination I have inside of me. And yes, there's there's part of that. Not going to like completely erase my role in all of this, but I think a big part was that it was coming to a point with my health and nervous system where I was starting to hit a point of not no return, but like it's interesting. I eat well. I do yoga. I do medit. I do all the things right, but I think I was using those as a way of mitigating how much stress I was under as opposed to actually what those things are really for are compasses and points towards our truth.

Like >> I have no idea. >> My body just started being like no. I went from being someone who I would say I still handle stress and pressure well and in the moment I could always do it, but the cost afterwards was starting to get more and more serious to the point where it was like I'd always turned down or actually I remember I was in my early 20ies when a publicist first offered me a beta blocker.

I was nervous before I could carpet and it's the only other time I ever took anything and I was fine for the two hours after I took it and then I got back to the room and when my feelings came back to me I was like over wrought with grief and feeling of of having blocked it. And so I' i'd always and after that I I never allowed anyone to give me anything again even though I was offered things multiple times and doctors wanting to give me things for jet lag and for sleep and for nerves and oh everyone takes it this is you know there's no shame in this or whatever but I just I felt like in order to keep going I was going to have to make a decision of like are you okay with being lowle level unwell and medicated essentially and I just knew that wasn't a choice for me.

And it didn't matter how many silent retreats I went on or how much yoga I did or like what new thing I did to try and take care of myself. It my body was done. And that was then I think when I went away and found a relationship with myself and my practice and and just having trust and faith in a way that I never had before. And I started listening more carefully to like these little whispers of like, oh, like maybe this should be the thing you do or like even coming and doing this of like I think you should go and do this podcast.

And even the like salt shaker and the pepper pot in front of you, you start to take on the shapes of your real life and you realize that your mind just starts creating all this drama for you even though there's nothing going on literally. And it was just it was such a wild experience to kind of sit there and be like, \"Oh my god. I'm the one creating all of my own drama. This is a nightmare. It's me. It's me. I'm the problem.\" And um I was like, \"I can't stay here. I can't do this. This is way too hard. Living with myself and my own thoughts is going to dry. This is unbearable.

I would try to like shame and blame myself into and like kind of shake myself up and and give myself these kinds of like talkings to to make myself do stuff. And sometimes to be honest with you, they work in the short term and in the long term they fail you miserably. Like they just do not work. I the only way that I have learned to change my patterns to show up for myself better to change in the ways I want to change and grow is to be loving towards myself.

Emma, something I wanted to ask you about that's difficult and challenging because it's something you spoke about earlier as to being such a big part of your life, an important part of your life, but recently there's been so many conversations and comments directly from JK Rowling, whether it's her saying she'd never forgive you for your views or the fact that when she was asked what ruins the movies for her, she named yourself and some of your co-stars. And I imagine that's an extremely difficult thing when you've been a part of someone's world, when you've felt connected",
  "saying she'd never forgive you for your views or the fact that when she was asked what ruins the movies for her, she named yourself and some of your co-stars. And I imagine that's an extremely difficult thing when you've been a part of someone's world, when you've felt connected to their work and then for it now to kind of be a full 180 and for someone to publicly say these things that can be quite extremely hurtful actually. How do you think about that? I really don't believe that by having had that experience and holding the love and support and views that I have mean that I can't and don't treasure Joe and the person that I that I had personal experiences with. I will never believe that one negates the other and that my experience of that person I don't get to keep and cherish. I to come back to our earlier thing like I just don't think these things are either or. I think it's my deepest wish that I I hope people who don't agree with my opinion will love me and I hope I can keep loving people who I don't necessarily share",

And I think that's a very very important way for me that I need to be able to move through life. M >> I just really I guess I to circle back around I really do believe in having conversations and that those are really important and that I don't know I guess where I've landed is it's not so much what we say or what we believe but very often how we say it. That's really important and that's really frustrating and not what you want to hear when you're really angry and upset with someone. Um, but I don't know. I just see this world right now where we seem to be giving permission for this kind of like throwing out of people or that people are disposable.

What is the best advice you've ever heard or received? I'm going to cheat slightly if you'll allow it. >> Yeah. >> I read Emergent Strategy by Adrian Marie Brown. It was given to me as a gift by my friend Amarie for my 30th birthday.

And so a kind of martyrdom was part of my sort of I understood was important in my and I think reading her book and reading about pleasure activism which is sort of the idea that like anything that you need to s that you want to sustain eg justice eg You need it to be easy and you need it to be pleasurable in a way because that's what's going to mean that you'll be able to do it for a long time. >> Part of my burnout was that I wasn't prioritizing pleasure and joy as the kind of like underpinning for even some of the the harder, more somber, more cerebral things that I was doing.

  "was that I wasn't prioritizing pleasure and joy as the kind of like underpinning for even some of the the harder, more somber, more cerebral things that I was doing. And I think >> that's such a great answer. changed my life. And I think we also have a model particularly within activism and um in lots of spaces but like this kind of sole individual charismatic leader and I like you you know I my heroes always Martin Luther King and Gandhi and you just saw this sort of like solitary person that was doing that and I think if I could go back and do anything differently it would be that when I embarked on some of the public activism that I did. I wouldn't go in the way I did. I would go in with what I have now, which is not just like an activist community. Like I have friends who can give me feedback and who I can talk to and who I feel that I'm not doing the work alone solo. However that might look. Yeah. I guess heroicism and and martyrdom the way the way that it was looked maybe. I just don't",
  "Like I have friends who can give me feedback and who I can talk to and who I feel that I'm not doing the work alone solo. However that might look. Yeah. I guess heroicism and and martyrdom the way the way that it was looked maybe. I just don't believe that's how we'll get the job done anymore. Anything anything good will get done. >> So I think that book and I think that idea that revolutionized my approach. >> I love that. Yeah, that's a great answer. It's beautiful. I want to read that book now. >> I haven't read it. >> You have to. You have to have her on the podcast. >> Yeah, I should. Yeah, absolutely. Uh question number two. What is the worst advice you've ever heard or received? >> Oh, >> so much. >> How long have you got? >> God, mostly just like I think a lot of stuff around toughen up, bottle it up. >> Um, >> deal with that later, you know, just like subtle versions of like, well, maybe tell the truth, but just not all of it.

Cuz like the truth is the problem with like telling three quarters of the truth is that then you're sort of in this like constant >> peeling and unpeeling of yourself where you sort of like you're sort of trying to do it but you're not quite doing it. And I don't know I think a lot of advice around that. Also anyone that tells you not to do what you love terrible advice doing what you love will lead you where you need to go even if you can't see it at the time. Uh yeah. Yeah. Think about terrible terrible beauty tips and advice given around like >> I don't know just like oh god all again like back to our previous conversation all the ridiculous things that you are encouraged to try and do as a woman like",
  "it at the time. Uh yeah. Yeah. Think about terrible terrible beauty tips and advice given around like >> I don't know just like oh god all again like back to our previous conversation all the ridiculous things that you are encouraged to try and do as a woman like fake tan and and I mean it's hilarious. I actually right now I I it might be like well covered up, but I accidentally have a had a bottle of fake tan in my bathroom and in my jet lag state last night I thought I was putting moisturizer on, but now I have like these >> like horrific uh fake tan marks on my legs and feet. I guess I'm just thinking about just like oh my god. And recently I was like, \"Okay, I want to get my teeth whitened.\" And I looked like Ross from Friends when he'd had that awful fake tanning accident because they were just way too white. And then I had to spend go back for two other visits to get the dentist to put my teeth back to my normal teeth. So I guess I was just laughing thinking about like worse",
  "he'd had that awful fake tanning accident because they were just way too white. And then I had to spend go back for two other visits to get the dentist to put my teeth back to my normal teeth. So I guess I was just laughing thinking about like worse advice is just like don't ever listen to beauty technicians or anyone advising you to do anything weird to your body, face, appearance. Just just don't don't listen. Don't don't take the bait. Just don't do it. >> So good. Best answer. Best answer. >> Question number three. How are you how are you now going to choose work projects or activism differently? >> Does the person that's asking me to do something with them, uh, can they confidently look at me and say that they care about me far more than like what we're producing? and and do I care about them that way? One of my favorite people I worked with, Steve Chabosski, uh I remember him leaving what was a very productive uh rehearsal or script meeting with Logan Lurman, Ezra Miller and I and he was like, I need to go and be with my wife",

One of my favorite people I worked with, Steve Chabosski, uh I remember him leaving what was a very productive uh rehearsal or script meeting with Logan Lurman, Ezra Miller and I and he was like, I need to go and be with my wife now. And we were like, I don't think I've ever heard I mean, at that point, I certainly had ever heard a director in my career say they needed to leave for a personal reason or for a personal relationship, but I worked far harder for Steve than I worked for any other director because >> I think I was able to be a far give a far more vulnerable performance in that film because I felt that he really cared about me beyond the product of the film. And I want to work with people like that who for whom the process is as important as the outcome and the people that are part of it are more important than whatever the outcome is. I think this is a really difficult thing that I see everywhere in the world right now is that we treat objects and things like",

I think this is a really difficult thing that I see everywhere in the world right now is that we treat objects and things like they're sacred and we don't treat people like they're the sacred thing. And that switch Yeah. I think it causes a lot of pain. >> Emma, something that you told me when we were speaking on the phone >> was that you've been working with young people >> on helping them with some of the challenges that you've faced in your own career and your own life. >> Yeah. >> And I remember being so touched by that and I wanted to learn more and for you to share it because >> I Yeah. I just think it's really special and I was sharing it with some of my team before you arrived and and everyone was quite drawn to it. So, >> as a young person, and you know, as I've basically shared over however long it's been that we've been speaking, I just really needed to be having",
  "and I was sharing it with some of my team before you arrived and and everyone was quite drawn to it. So, >> as a young person, and you know, as I've basically shared over however long it's been that we've been speaking, I just really needed to be having more conversations with people my own age and people that were older than me. I feel like I tried to navigate so many problems on my own and I just didn't know who to really speak to and I was speaking to such a narrow group of people about what I was trying to navigate and I I just I think that working with young people and giving them each other and also the space, the reason, the excuses to talk about the things that we don't talk about or create spaces for has been the most gratifying, the most purposeful and of service I felt in a long time because it turns out pretty often that a lot of the things that we're struggling with, other people are struggling with as well.

It's been the best most the best most gratifying thing. And I feel really lucky to be in a position and in a place where I can say and know like like I've kind of done this treacherous journey. And I think that I think I might have some ideas about what might be needed for someone to come out the other side of that safely. >> So it feels good to be of use. >> Yeah. I love that. Fifth and final question. We ask this to every guest who's ever been on the show. If you could create one law that everyone in the world had to follow, what would it be? >> Oh wow. One law. Okay. There's a couple of contenders. I want to run you through one of them",

There's a couple of contenders. I want to run you through one of them with you. One is going to be >> We'll vote on them. >> Okay. Great. Perfect. One would be around the importance of telling the truth or like speaking your truth or just because I feel like so much so much chaos is caused by people not being sure whether or not they should or it's a good idea to or I think that would be a pretty amazing one. Uh, another contender I mean it's the obvious one is treat other people as you would like to be treated. That would obviously solve a lot of problems as well. >> I like that one. You gave >> the last one? >> Yeah, the first one. The first one. >> Oh, the first one. Yeah. The truth. Yeah. I guess it took me a long time and probably probably through doing my yoga teacher training is speaking truth with kindness",

I guess it took me a long time and probably probably through doing my yoga teacher training is speaking truth with kindness is one of the first nyamas, right? >> Very disappointed. I can't remember what the word is in >> not sata >> maybe. Yeah. Speaking the truth with kind like speaking the truth with kindness. I think of the >> there's an amazing there's an amazing quote which actually is was given to me recently by a friend which is like the truth the truth without kindness is brutality and kindness without truth is manipulation. >> Say that again. >> Truth without kindness is brutality and kindness without truth is manipulation. And so when I say like tell your truth, I don't mean going around like just being awful to everyone. I mean like telling the microscopic truth and like having those being willing to have a tolerance for those conversations. One of my favorite metaphors, I actually wrote about this recently for being in a relationship with anyone is",
  "I don't mean going around like just being awful to everyone. I mean like telling the microscopic truth and like having those being willing to have a tolerance for those conversations. One of my favorite metaphors, I actually wrote about this recently for being in a relationship with anyone is like you're in it's in a way it's it's a dance. It's a fight. Like I think about boxing in the sense of like who is going to go down to the mat with you and like not tap out because >> being honest about what's really going on is uncomfortable and it's risky as we talked about earlier. You risk every time you tell the truth of maybe losing someone that you love because you don't know how they're going to respond to whatever your truth is. But I think to live that way creates the intimacy and connection that I think we long for >> and also like sets people free in a way. You and them truth. Yeah. Truth with kindness.

The third is it shouldn't agitate the minds of others. >> Wow. >> And the fourth is it should be aligned with eternal wisdom and timeless wisdom. >> That's beautiful and perfect because yeah, I think there's truths which are if they're not beneficial that do just agitate.
