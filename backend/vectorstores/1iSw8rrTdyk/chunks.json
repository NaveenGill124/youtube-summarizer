  "The  most  powerful  thing  we  can  do  when feeling  powerless  is  admit  what  is  true. Because  so  often  I'm  afraid  of  being lonely  and  I  already  am.  I'm  afraid things  are  going  to  change.  They've already  changed.  Fear  wastess  air. That's  the  magic  of  my  guest  today,  Mark Nepo.  He's  the  number  one  New  York  Times best-selling  author  of  the  seinal  work, The  Book  of  Awakening,  which  has  changed millions  of  people's  lives,  including mine  and  my  husband,  Chris.  Can  you  talk a  little  bit  about  what  Mark's  work  has meant  to  you  in  your  life? >> Everything. >> Some  of  the  gifts  that  you've  offered  me is  just  noticing  that  there's  lots  to listen  to,  not  just  outside,  but  inside. What  I  want  to  offer  is  that  the difficulty  of  any  moment  is  only  half  of reality.  Life  is  more  than  anything  we could  dream  of  if  we  truly  meet  each other  and  meet  ourselves  right  here, right  now. >> I  have  a  feeling  that  the  person listening  is  either  before  the  wall  of fire  or  watching  somebody  else  in  their life  deeply  struggling.  Often  the  the intent  is  to  focus  on  one  thing  when really  we're  dealing  with  a kaleidoscope.  And  how  do  you  actually try  to  take  in  absorb  all  of  that? >> There's  two  ways  that  human  beings  will basically  learn.  One  is  by  willfully shedding  and  the  other  is  by  being broken  open.  And  if  you  don't  willfully shed,  don't  worry,  you'll  be  broken open. >> Hey,  it's  your  friend  Mel  and  welcome  to the  Mel  Robbins  Podcast. Mark  Nepo,  it  is  an  honor  to  welcome  you to  the  Mel  Robbins  podcast. >> Well,  it's  an  honor  to  be  here.  I'm  so appreciate  you've  all  made  me  so welcome.

  ">> Hey,  it's  your  friend  Mel  and  welcome  to the  Mel  Robbins  Podcast. Mark  Nepo,  it  is  an  honor  to  welcome  you to  the  Mel  Robbins  podcast. >> Well,  it's  an  honor  to  be  here.  I'm  so appreciate  you've  all  made  me  so welcome.  I'm  just  so  looking  forward  to being  together. >> Me,  too.  And  Chris  Robbins,  this  is  your debut  in  the  Boston  studios.  Thank  you for  being  here,  too. >> Thanks  for  having  me  in.  So  Mark,  I'd love  to  start  by  having  you  speak directly  to  the  person  who's  here  with us  who  made  the  time  to  spend  it together  with  you  today  and  me  and  Chris and  to  learn  from  you.  And  I'd  love  to have  you  just  speak  to  them  and  share what  they  could  experience  in  their  life that  could  be  different. >> Yeah.  So  first,  thank  you  for  being  here and  taking  time  to  gather  like  this.  I think  some  of  the  things  that  that  are so  important  and  available  to  everyone is  that  life  is  always  where  we  are.  I think  one  of  the  big  menacing assumptions  in  the  modern  world  is  that life  is  other  than  where  we  are.  It's over  there.  You  know,  the  the  FOMO,  fear of  missing  out. You  know  that  there  is  no  there.  There's only  here.  And  great  love  and  great suffering  are  the  great  teachers  of this.  I  think  one  of  the  things  in  our age  right  now  and  our  is  that  so  many people  seem  to  have  lost  their  direct connection  to  life and  it  is  is  so  isolating is  so  challenging. Um,  my  job,  whether  it's  in  writing  or teaching, my  calling  is  to  open  a  heart  space  that we  can  enter  together. And  in  that  heart  space,  we  start  to discover  that  we're  more  together  than alone. >> I'm  so  happy  you're  here. >> Me,  too.  Well,  your  work  has  had  a profound  impact  on  my  life,  on  Chris's life,  on  our  family's  life,  and  I'm talking  about  the  book  of  Awakening  that I  just  have  to  say  Chris  is  the  one  who introduced  your  work  to  our  family.  And so  before  you  know  we  share  some  of  our favorite  passages,  can  you  talk  a  little bit  about",
  "profound  impact  on  my  life,  on  Chris's life,  on  our  family's  life,  and  I'm talking  about  the  book  of  Awakening  that I  just  have  to  say  Chris  is  the  one  who introduced  your  work  to  our  family.  And so  before  you  know  we  share  some  of  our favorite  passages,  can  you  talk  a  little bit  about how  you  discovered  this  book  or  what this  book  means  to  you  or  what  Mark's work  has  meant  to  you  in  your  life? Everything. This  book  came  to  me  uh  when  my  heart was  not  open. I  had  um gotten  pretty  heavy  into  meditation,  was studying  Buddhism  and  somebody we  were  talking  about  this  concept  of quieting  the  mind  and  meditation  and somebody  said,  \"Oh,  well,  I  just  read one  of  these  passages  before  I  before  I drop  in.\"  And  that  was  the  be  that  was sort  of  the  beginning  of  me  finding  this book.  And  um you  know  I  think  just  looking  back  on what  has  been  a  decade  plus  of both  reading  and  rereading  this  um  and sharing  it  profusely. Um it  it  has  been  the  source  of  my  own awakening  if  you  will.  And  um  and  also uh  just  a  reminder  to  your  point  about how we  don't  you  know  nobody  has  the answers.  I  love  what  you  said  earlier, like  we're  all  just  here  comparing  notes >> and  uh  and  this  is  a  book  that  I give  away  in  all  of  the  men's  work  that I  do. >> Thank  you. >> Um it  provides  a  light  and  a  lens  into uh  our  own  humanity,  my  own  humanity. >> Oh,  thank  you. >> Thank  you. >> You're  welcome.  It  means  a  lot.  M >> I  went  through  a  large  part  of  my  life",
  "I  do. >> Thank  you. >> Um it  provides  a  light  and  a  lens  into uh  our  own  humanity,  my  own  humanity. >> Oh,  thank  you. >> Thank  you. >> You're  welcome.  It  means  a  lot.  M >> I  went  through  a  large  part  of  my  life closed  off  and  in  my  head  or  detached  or disassociated  or  anxious  or  just  like the  doing  and  the  climbing  of  the  ladder and  the  getting  to  the  next  thing  and  go go  go  go go  go  go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go  go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go  go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go disconnected  from  life  itself  as  you would  say  in  terms  of  this  feel  of  it like  there  was  so  much  of  the  doing  and the  achieving  and  I  just  thought  this  is what  life  is  this  is  and  that  is  a  form of  life  And too  many  people  get  to  their  deathbed and  realize, >> yeah, >> that  there  could  have  been  a  different way  to  experience  life  and  a  different way  to  slow  down  and  really  truly connect  with  what  matters.  And  it's right  there  in  front  of  you.  And what  I  hope  out  of  this  conversation, because  it's  the  thing  that  I've  gotten out  of  your  work,  is  this  ability  to wake  up  from  autopilot  or  from  the feeling  that  you're  in  a  relationship that  feels  like  roommates  or  that  you are  stuck  or  resigned  or  closed  off,  but you  don't  know  how  to  access  something else.  There  is  something  else  that  is possible.  If  the  person  listening really  resonates  with  that  sense  that I've  lost  the  direct  connection  to  life or  there  is  somebody  in  my  life  that  I'm worried  about  who  seems  to  have  lost their  direct  connection  to  life.  The sparks  gone. They  seem  really  stuck. You  see  the  potential. you  see  the  light.  You're  holding  it  out for  them,  but  they  don't  see  it.  Or maybe  the  person  listening  doesn't  feel it.  What  would  you  say  to  them,  Mark? >> You  know,  I  think  I  think  two  questions, non-judgmental  questions  that  I  find myself  asking  both  loved  ones  and students  and  people  I'm  with,  especially",
  "you  see  the  light.  You're  holding  it  out for  them,  but  they  don't  see  it.  Or maybe  the  person  listening  doesn't  feel it.  What  would  you  say  to  them,  Mark? >> You  know,  I  think  I  think  two  questions, non-judgmental  questions  that  I  find myself  asking  both  loved  ones  and students  and  people  I'm  with,  especially people  who  are  struggling,  is  what's  it like  to  be  you  right  now? >> What's  it  like  to  be  you? And  the  other  is  what  do  you  care  about >> and  invite  them  to  tell  that  story and  not  not  even,  you  know,  tell  them they're  stuck.  What  good  does  that  do? Or  cheer  up.  Did  that  ever  work? Yeah.  What's  it  like  to  be  you? What's  it  like?  You  know,  and  this  this came  I  learned  this  from,  you  know,  I mean,  one  of  the  best  things  for  me about  teaching  is in  opening  that  heart  space when  people  enter  and  are  real when  who's  the  teacher  moves  around  the room.  It  doesn't  get  better  than  that. >> And  one  of  this  this  story  where  this question  came  to  me  was  I  was  teaching in  Charleston  at  the  Sophia  Institute,  a place  I  love.  The  question  I  had  asked was,  can  you  in  pairs,  broke  up  in little  groups,  can  you  share  one  uh  one thing  you  hold  to  be  true  with  the  other person?  So,  this  mother  and  son  came  up to  me  in  the  middle  and  the  mother  spoke um  and  uh  and  she  said,  \"Well,  we're stuck.\"  I  said,  \"Well,  what's  what's going  on?\"  And  meanwhile,  her  son,  who is  probably  28,  about  64,  you  know,  he's just  got  this  rise  smile  on  his  face. And  uh  she  says,  \"Well,  I  told  I  told Jack  what  was  true  for  me,  but  he  said that  that  not  he  doesn't  think anything's  true,  so  I  we're we're  at  an impass.\" And  I  didn't  know  I  was  going  to  say this,  but  because  they  shared,  my  heart said,  \"Well,  I'm  inviting  you  to  listen to  each  other.  So  if  if  your  son  moved to  China, what  you  know,  would  you  ask  him  what's it  like  to  live  in  China?  What  brought",
  "anything's  true,  so  I  we're we're  at  an impass.\" And  I  didn't  know  I  was  going  to  say this,  but  because  they  shared,  my  heart said,  \"Well,  I'm  inviting  you  to  listen to  each  other.  So  if  if  your  son  moved to  China, what  you  know,  would  you  ask  him  what's it  like  to  live  in  China?  What  brought you  there?  Do  you  like  living  there?  Do you  see  yourself  staying  there?  Well, he's  told  you  he  lives  in  the  land  where nothing  is  true.  Can  you  ask  him  what's it  like  to  live  in  the  land  where nothing  is  true?  What  brought  you  there? And  he's  smiling  the  whole  time,  not saying  a  word.  And  they  went  back.  Well, what  happened  in  the  retreat  was  there was  another  mother  grieving  that  she  had a  son  of  a  similar  age  about  a  month earlier  who  had  died  in  a  car  crash. >> And  watching  this  mother  and  son,  she  a little  later  in  the  weekend  burst  into tears  and  left  the  room.  And  we  took  a break and  um  made  sure  she  was  okay.  And  when she  came  back  into  the  room,  this  young man  who  didn't  believe  anything  was  true was  the  first  one  to  run  across  the  room and  sweep  her  up  in  his  arms just and  so  at  the  end  of  the  retreat  as  we were  saying  goodbye  to  different  people and  he  was  taller  than  me,  I  went  up,  he came  up  and  I  said,  \"Can  I  share something  with  you?\"  He  said,  \"Sure.\" And  I  put  my  hand  on  his  heart  and  I said,  \"Whatever  caused  you  to  reach  out to  that  grieving  mother,  that  was  true.\" Now,  that  you  can't  you  don't  plan things  like  that. He  he  who  believed  nothing  was  true  was the  teacher  that  weekend. It's  one  of  the  um it's  one  of  the  reasons  why  I  think  this some  of  your  teachings  and  your  writings are  so  profound  because  you  you're  not offering  answers and  um  even  this  book  of  awakening  I think",
  "it's  one  of  the  reasons  why  I  think  this some  of  your  teachings  and  your  writings are  so  profound  because  you  you're  not offering  answers and  um  even  this  book  of  awakening  I think uh  It  doesn't  lead  people  to  what  is true. Um,  it  doesn't force  people  to  ask  for  help. Um,  but  it  does invite by  way  of  the  prompts  and  the  the reflections. Uh, it  inspires  people  to  ask  those questions. And  I  think  for  at  least  for  a  lot  of the  people  that  I  sit  with,  particularly men  who  are  not  inclined  necessarily  to ask  for  help  or  hey,  you  know,  I'm  going to  I'm  going  to  get  this  done.  I'm  going to  go  it  alone.  Um I'm  not  sure  that  it's  always  so  clear what  is  true  or  what  help  is  required. And  so  I  I'm  seeing  at least  even  in this  conversation  that  that's  part  of what  without  me  even  knowing  it  has spoken  to  me  because  it's it's  given  me  the  space  and  the  presence of  mind  to  even  ask  these  questions  of myself  or  I  mean  in  the  case  of  Mel  and I  just  doing  it  together  with  friends and  with  one  another.  It's your  your  story  of  that  young  man  speaks volumes  to  that. >> Oh,  thank  you.  And  this  is  the  blessing, you  know,  because  for  me it's  this  is  how  I  learn. >> The  book  of  awakening  sits  on  both  sides of  our  beds  because  we  do  not  want  to share  a  copy.  Although  I  am  holding Chris's  copy  because  I  forgot  to  bring mine  and  so  I'm  like,  Chris,  bring yours.  And  it  is  a  beautiful  collection of  daily  reflections  that  were  born  out of  a  very  challenging  time  in  your  life when  you  were  dealing  with  a  cancer",
  "share  a  copy.  Although  I  am  holding Chris's  copy  because  I  forgot  to  bring mine  and  so  I'm  like,  Chris,  bring yours.  And  it  is  a  beautiful  collection of  daily  reflections  that  were  born  out of  a  very  challenging  time  in  your  life when  you  were  dealing  with  a  cancer diagnosis.  So  can  you  talk  a  little  bit about >> sure >> that  period  of  your  life  and >> what  was  happening  that  led  to  this series  of  essays?  So  when  I  was  in  my early  30s  and  and  um  you  know  I  was  I was  in  just  finished  graduate  school  um and  I  was  you  know  I  was  a  young  poet who  I  I  hope  maybe  maybe  if  I  worked really  hard  I  might  write  one  or  two poems  that  maybe  would  matter  or  be thought  of  as  great  you  know  and  then all  of  a  sudden  I  was  you  know  I  was stricken  with  a  rare  form  of  lymphoma and  everything  was  upended.  And  I  was  in the  hospital  and  it  was  in  uh  my  skull bone.  It  had  grown  to  the  size  of  a grapefruit.  And  then  when  someone  told me  I  had  cancer, I  walked  out  that  door  and  that  was  the first life-changing  moment  because the  door  I  had  come  in  by  was  no  longer there. Life  before  that  appointment, there  was  no  way  back. And  now  I  was  in  the  new  world. And  now  in  that  moment  everything  was difficult,  fearful. And  then  I  had  to  somehow  you  know everyone  and  this  is  the  kind  of  common passage.  Everyone  that  all  the  spiritual traditions  talk  about  everyone  will  be dropped  into  the  depth  of  life  at  some point  and  and  sometime  and  it  you  know  a lot  of  times  we  talk  about  it  because difficult  life  challenging  things  bring us  there  but  it's  not  just  that.  It's not  we're  not  deifying  suffering. It's  not  just  that.  It  could  be  wonder. It  could  be  beauty.  It  could  be  being loved  unconditionally  for  the  first time.  You  know  it  could  be  all  kinds  of things.  But  it  happened  to  be  cancer  for me.  And  so  in  that  journey I  had  to  uh  drop  under",
  "not  we're  not  deifying  suffering. It's  not  just  that.  It  could  be  wonder. It  could  be  beauty.  It  could  be  being loved  unconditionally  for  the  first time.  You  know  it  could  be  all  kinds  of things.  But  it  happened  to  be  cancer  for me.  And  so  in  that  journey I  had  to  uh  drop  under the  pain,  the  fear,  the  worry.  Again, not  to  run  from  it,  but  to  act  some access  something  larger  than  me. And  this  is  maybe  the  difference  between effort  and  grace,  you  know,  so  that  you the  effort  is  to  be  ready  so  that  when grace  comes,  you  receive  it.  And  and  you know,  we  can  talk  about  grace  very simply  outside  of  religious  connotations as  the  larger  currents  of  life  that we're  always  connected  to  and  if  we're open  to  them, they  will  carry  us. I'd  never  been  through  anything difficult.  So,  I  was  terrified.  I  mean, every  doctor  or  nurse  I  met,  I  said, \"I'm  Mark.  Put  me  out.\"  They  thought  put me  out  was  my  last  name.  Yeah.  And  uh and  of  course,  I  couldn't  be  put  out because  this  was  my  journey. They  didn't  um  in  order  to  be  ready  in case  I  needed  to  go  into  surgery quickly,  they  couldn't  give  me anesthetic  ahead  of  time  so  it  wouldn't be  used  up.  So  I  had  to  go  through  all these  things  pretty  much  awake  or  with local  or  things.  So  there  I  was  being challenged  to  feel  it  all  to  face  it all.  So  I  had  my  first  chemo  treatment. I  went  into  a  a  holiday  in  with  my former  wife  and  dear  dear  friend  uh  who were  still  dear  friends  after  all  these years.  And  the  only  medicine  they  gave me  was  oral.  So  I  started  getting  sick. This  is  was  after  I  had  a  rib  removed  in my  back.  So  two  weeks  earlier.  So,  I'm getting  sick  and  throwing  up  every  half hour  and  feeling  like  it's  got  to  stop. And  I  was  feeling  afraid,  in  pain,  not sure  what's  going  on.  And  somehow,  and this  is  what  I  mean  about  being  ready for  grace.  All  of  a  sudden,  the  sun's starting  to  come  up.  And  it  because  I was  open  and  maybe  open  because  of  all the  pain,  exhausted,",
  "And  I  was  feeling  afraid,  in  pain,  not sure  what's  going  on.  And  somehow,  and this  is  what  I  mean  about  being  ready for  grace.  All  of  a  sudden,  the  sun's starting  to  come  up.  And  it  because  I was  open  and  maybe  open  because  of  all the  pain,  exhausted, it  occurred  to  me  that  somewhere  nearby a  baby's  being  born.  M >> and  somewhere  nearby,  a  couple's  making love  for  the  first  time. And  somewhere  further  down  the  road,  a  a father  and  a  son  who  haven't  spoke  in years  are  finally  sitting  down  and having  coffee.  And  it  was  in  that  moment that  I  discovered  that  to  be  broken  is no  reason  to  see  all  things  as  broken. >> You  know,  I  was  raised  Jewish.  I  have  a great  tie  to  the  Jewish  heritage.  But through  all  this,  I  became  a  student  of all  paths  and  that's  informed  all  my books,  all  my  teaching.  And  because  then and  even  all  these  years  later, you  know,  I'm  uh  because  the  tumor  in  my brain  vanished.  That  was  a  miracle.  The surgery  removed  the  rib.  That  was  a miracle.  Even  the  damn  chemo  was  a miracle.  So  I  was  not  and  I'm  still  not wise  enough  to  know  what  worked  and  what didn't. >> And  I  feel  like  I  was  challenged  to believe  in  everything. And  so  I  really  see  the  the  common center  of  all  formal  and  informal  paths, the  unique  gifts  of  each and  and  how  do  we  how  do  we  share  them? How  do  we  make  use  of  them? Well,  what  I  love  about  this  book  so much  is  first  of  all,  I  really appreciate  the  format  that  there  is  an essay  every  day  that  you  can  read  that takes  you  five  minutes  or  less,  but  that has  you,  as  you  say,  drop  into  the  depth of  life.  And  I  read  a  page  and  I  drop  in and  feel  very  centered  and  connected  to something  larger.  and  I  feel  very present  in  the  moment  and  then  I  close it  and  feel  very  satisfied.  And  if  I read  it  the  next  day,  great.  If  I  forget about  it  and  I  open  it  up  a  month  later, great.  There  it  is.  Like  an  old  friend",

It's  June  6th  and  it  it's called  Two  Monkeys  Sleeping. We  wandered  into  a  corner  of  the  Central Park  Zoo.  And  there,  despite  the  dozens of  tourists  pointing  and  tapping  the glass,  two  monkeys  were  squinting  on  a purchase  stone.  To  our  surprise,  they were  both  in  deep  sleep,  their  dark heads  bowed  to  each  other,  their  small frames  limp.  What  was  amazing  was  that their  delicate  hands  were  touching, their  monkey  fingers  leaning  into  each other.  It  was  clear  that  it  was  this small,  sustained  touch  that  allowed  them to  sleep.  As  long  as  they  were  touching, they  could  let  go.  I  envied  their  trust and  simplicity.  There  was  none  of  the human  pretense  at  independence.  They clearly  needed  each  other  to  experience peace.  One  stirred  but  didn't  wake  and the  other  in  sleep  kept  their  fingers touching.  How  deeply  rewarding  the  life of  touch.  Each  was  drifting  inwardly dreaming  whatever  monkeys  dream.  They looked  like  ancient  travelers  praying inside  a  place  of  rest  made  possible because  they  dared  to  stay  connected.  It was  one  of  the  most  tender  and  humbling moments  I've  ever  seen.  Two  aging monkeys  weaving  fingertips  as  if  their touch  alone  kept  them  from  oblivion. I  pray  for  the  courage  to  be  as  simple in  asking  for  what  I  need. >> You  know,  I  I  read  that  and  I  can picture  it  and  then  I  immediately  have  a very  small-minded  thought.  How  is  it that  Mark  goes  to  the  zoo  and  sees",

How  is  it that  Mark  goes  to  the  zoo  and  sees something  so  profound  and  I  see  the other  monkeys  throwing  poop and  my  stomach  grumbling? And  you  know,  I'm  joking,  but  we're talking  about  the  heart  space  and  we're talking  about  the  depth  of  life  and we're  talking  about  kind  of  the  noticing of  what's  right  here. What  do  you  hope  that  that  essay  stirs for  somebody? >> The  the  courage to  stay  connected >> both  to  ourselves,  each  other  and  this larger  this  larger  mystery  of  life.  You know,  one  of  the  things  that  is  so important  is  and  and  so  it's  about,  you know,  first,  you  know,  Chris,  as  you shared,  we  all  sh  we  all  have  times  when we're  closed  and  we  don't  realize  it. And  so  the  first  kind  of  practice  is  to open. But  then  the  next  practice  is  to  connect because  you  know  if  I  open  my  eyes, what's  the  point  if  I  don't  see  and  if  I open  my  heart  and  I  don't  love  what's the  point  of  opening  it?  So  we  have  to open  and  then  we  have  to  reach  and receive while  all  the  stuff  is  while  the  poop  is being  thrown  while  the  because  you  know we  we  talk  about  things  in  life  we separate  them  so  we  can  make  sense  of them  but  that's  not  how  they  exist  in life  like  so  we  talk  about  suffering  and we  talk  about  beauty  but  you  know  we there's  a  great  table  a  geological beautiful  organized  table  of  all  the elements  but  If  you  go  and  you  cut  into a  mountain,  they're  all  jumbled  up.  And that's  the  way  life  is.  And  so  when we're  suffer,  while  we're  suffering  is when  we  need  to  let  beauty  in. >> While  we're  closed  is  when  we  need  to find  the  quiet  courage  to  open. While  we're  afraid,  and  if  I  can't  do it,  I  need  to  ask  you  for  help.",
  "a  mountain,  they're  all  jumbled  up.  And that's  the  way  life  is.  And  so  when we're  suffer,  while  we're  suffering  is when  we  need  to  let  beauty  in. >> While  we're  closed  is  when  we  need  to find  the  quiet  courage  to  open. While  we're  afraid,  and  if  I  can't  do it,  I  need  to  ask  you  for  help. That's  the  whole  point  of  friendship. You  know,  one  of  the  great  I  think central  paradoxes  of  life  is  that  no  one has  been  here  who's  you.  No  one  can  see what  you've  seen  or  or  live  your  life and  no  one  can  do  it  alone. I  think  one  of  the  modern  psychological diseases is  that  we  think  we  should  do  it  alone. And and  so  this,  you  know,  this  this  sense which  goes  back  to  manifest  destiny  in America.  Um,  no,  we're,  you  know,  we're interdependent. We're  interdependent. No  one  can  live  my  life  for  me,  but  I can't  do  it  alone. >> And  I  know  this  from  all  the  things  I've been  through. Why  do  you  think  these  simple  things  can act  like  such  a  lifeline  or  open  you  up when  otherwise  in  life  you  kind  of  are going  through  life  feeling  very  closed off  and  lonely?  And >> yeah,  I  think  that  um I  one  of  the  things  I  I  mentioned earlier,  but  I  it's  really  been  a  great teacher  for  me  is  that  great  love  and great  suffering  are  the  great  openers. And  you  know,  there's  two  ways  that human  beings  will  basically  learn.  One is  by  willfully  shedding  and  the  other is  by  being  broken  open.  And  if  you don't  willfully  shed,  don't  worry, you'll  be  broken  open.  And  often  it's  a combination.  And  so words  and  phrases  and  expressions  that matter are  expressed in  those  openings >> and  therefore  whether  it  comes  from  me or  you  or  a  friend  while  you're struggling  um  those are  the  great  openers  and  then  it's",
  "matter are  expressed in  those  openings >> and  therefore  whether  it  comes  from  me or  you  or  a  friend  while  you're struggling  um  those are  the  great  openers  and  then  it's open.  That's  why  it's  important  to  have that  heart  space  open.  So  when  that comes,  yes,  a  phrase,  you  know,  I  had  a a  dear  friend  and  mentor  um  who  lived  to be  102,  Joel  Elkis.  He  was  a  child  of the  Holocaust.  He  was  a  doctor.  He  was  a watercolorist.  I  met  him  when  he  was  80 and  thought,  \"How  much  time  do  we  have?\" And  we  had  22  years.  And  you  know,  one sentence  he  said  to  me  when  I  was  just beginning  years  ago  was  such  an  opening for  me.  He  said,  um, you  have  a  gift. Honor  it  and  let  it  be  your  teacher. And  you  know,  at  a  time  when  I  wasn't sure  I  had  a  gift, you  know,  that  was  such  a  uh  such  an such  an  opening  for  me  that  that  really has  stayed  with  me  my  whole  life. >> What  does  that  mean?  You  think  like  can you  unpack  that  a  little  bit?  You  have  a gift. >> Yeah. >> Honor  it  and  let  it  be  your  teacher. What  is  that?  Because  you  also  said everybody  has  a  gift.  How  do  you >> honor  your  gift  and  how  do  you  let  that gift  be  your  teacher?  It  could  be,  you know,  you  might  have  a  gift  for  growing things. That's  the  call  of  your  soul where  we  use  it  in  the  world. What  is  how  how  are  you  going  to  grow? Are  you  going  to  grow  plants?  Are  you going  to  grow  people?  Are  you  going  to grow  children?  Are  you  you  know  what  are you  going  to  grow?  And  so  this  is  where we  apply  it  in  the  world.  So  all  of  this is  a  journey.  So  to  honor,  and  this  is  a very  uh  so  the  word  honor,  you  know,  I  I love,  as  you  know  from  my  writing,  the origins  of  words,  not  because  I'm  a  word geek,  but  because  I've  noticed  that words  erode  over  time, >> just  like  stone  and  wood,  you  know,  and so  when  we  go  back,  more  often  than  not, their  original  or  as  close  as  we  can get,  their  original  definitions  are  more whole  and  so  much  more  helpful.  So",
  "origins  of  words,  not  because  I'm  a  word geek,  but  because  I've  noticed  that words  erode  over  time, >> just  like  stone  and  wood,  you  know,  and so  when  we  go  back,  more  often  than  not, their  original  or  as  close  as  we  can get,  their  original  definitions  are  more whole  and  so  much  more  helpful.  So honor,  I  love  the  original  definition  of the  word  honor.  Honor  means  to  keep  what is  true  in  view. >> I  love  that  to  keep  what  is  true  in view.  So  for  everyone  who's  with  us  and listening,  how  can  you  practice  person? How  can  you  how  can  you  personalize  the practice  of  honoring? How  do  you  keep  what  is  true  in  view about  what  you  know  about  yourself  and your  gifts?  So  I  think  that  you  know  the first  step  for  any  of  us  is  to  you  know the  word  trust  literally  means  follow your  heart. So  to  follow  our  hearts  in  a  daily  way. What  brings  you  more  alive?  What  is heartening?  Forget  about  whether  it's  a career  or  a  project  or  just  what  do  you do  during  the  day  or  that  brings  you more  alive  and  then  do  more  of  it.  It could  be  staring  at  the  sky  or  it  could be  making  meals  for  friends  or  it  could be  stamp  collecting  or  it  could  be  you know  I  have  a  a  dear  friend  um  that friend  Paul  who  helped  me  through  my cancer  journey  all  those  years  ago  and one  of  his  great  gifts  I  mean  he  did  all kinds  of  things  to  make  a  living  but  he followed  so  beautifully  you  know  he  when we  were  in  our  20s  he  he  created  an  art gallery  and  that  brought  him  alive  and it  was  a  wonderful  art  gallery  in Albany,  New  York.  And  then  it  changed and  you  know  the  next  thing  I  knew  he was  you  know  um  doing  sumi  painting himself  and  then  you  know  another  10 years  he  was  apprenticing  with  a  foreign car  mechanic and  he  just  followed  what  brought  him and  it  wasn't  whether  it  was  quote successful  or  not.  It  was  just  that  what brought  him  alive  shifted.  I  wouldn't",
  "himself  and  then  you  know  another  10 years  he  was  apprenticing  with  a  foreign car  mechanic and  he  just  followed  what  brought  him and  it  wasn't  whether  it  was  quote successful  or  not.  It  was  just  that  what brought  him  alive  shifted.  I  wouldn't even  say  see  as  long  as  we  take  the judgment  out  of  it  not  no  longer  works or  didn't  produce  something.  So,  you know,  one  of  the  things  is  that  happens to  all  of  us  when  we're  young. You're  spinning  in  recess  and  the teacher  says,  \"Boy,  you're  so  graceful. You'd  be  a  good  dancer.\" Or  hear  somebody  singing  la  over  in  the corner.  You  You  should  be  a  singer.  And now  all  of  a  sudden it  gets  in  our  heads  from  society  and from  okay how  what  do  I  have  to  do  to  become  a singer? Does  that  mean  I  have  to  take  lessons? Does  that  mean  I  have  to  get  a  recorded? Do  I  have  to  perform?  Or if  singing  brings  you  alive,  whether  you sing  well  or  not,  you're  a  singer. So,  how  do  we  stay  a  verb  and  not  become a  noun? And  this  is  at  the  heart  of  finding  our own  gift, you  know?  Um, I  think  it  I  think  it  was  Howard  Thurman who  said,  \"We  don't  need  we  don't  need people  Oh,  I  can't  remember  the  exact quote,  but  what  the  essence  of  it  was, we  need  people  who  are  alive, not  people  who  are  quote  good  at  what they  do.\"  Because  if  we're  alive,  we will  be  good  at  what  we  do.  M  well,  one of the  things  that  brings  me  alive  is reading  from  your  book  because  I  always drop  in  and  so  I  want  to  read  one >> to  you  and  then  I'd  love  to  hear  you kind  of  unpack  this  one.  So  this  one  is May  19th  and  it's  called  The  Bee  Comes. The  flower  doesn't  dream  of  the  bee,  it blossoms  and  the  bee  comes.  Why  am  I crying?  Mark  damn  you. Um, okay.  Uh, at  times  in  my  life,  I  have  wanted  love",
  "The  flower  doesn't  dream  of  the  bee,  it blossoms  and  the  bee  comes.  Why  am  I crying?  Mark  damn  you. Um, okay.  Uh, at  times  in  my  life,  I  have  wanted  love so  badly  that  I  have  reimagined  myself, reinvented  who  I  am  in  an  attempt  to  be more  desirable  or  more  deserving,  only to  discover  again  and  again  that  it  is the  tending  of  my  own  soul  that  invites the  natural  process  of  love  to  begin. I  remember  my  very  first  tumble  into love.  I  found  such  comfort  there  that like  Narcissus,  I  became  lost  in  how everything  other  than  my  pain  was reflected  in  her  beauty.  All  the  while  I was  abdicating  my  own  worth,  empowering her  as  the  key  to  my  sense  of  joy. If  I  have  learned  anything  through  the years,  it  is  that  though  we  discover  and experience  joy  with  others,  our  capacity for  joy  is  carried  like  a  pod  of  nectar and  our  very  own  breast.  I  now  believe that  our  deepest  vocation  is  to  root ourselves  enough  in  this  life  that  we can  open  our  hearts  to  the  light  of experience  and  so  bloom.  For  in  blooming we  attract  others.  In  being  so thoroughly  who  we  are,  an  inner fragrance  is  released  that  calls  others to  eat  of  our  nectar.  And  we  are  loved by  friends  and  partners  alike.  It  seems the  very  job  of  being  is  to  ready  us  for such  love.  By  attending  our  own  inner growth,  we  uncannily  become  exactly  who we  are.  And  like  the  tulip  whose  blossom petal  is  the  exact  shape  of  the  bee, >> our  self-actualization  attracts  a  host of  loving  others  more  real  than  all  our fantasies.  In  this  way,  the  universe continues  through  the  unexpected  coming together  of  blossomed  souls.  So  if  you can  give  up  the  want  of  another  and  be who  you  are  and  more  often  than  not  love will  come  at  the  precise  moment  you  are",
  "fantasies.  In  this  way,  the  universe continues  through  the  unexpected  coming together  of  blossomed  souls.  So  if  you can  give  up  the  want  of  another  and  be who  you  are  and  more  often  than  not  love will  come  at  the  precise  moment  you  are simply  loving  yourself. >> It's  so  beautiful. >> Oh,  thank  you.  You  read  it  beautifully. >> And  you  also  give  a  prompt  that  helps you  take  it  deeper.  You  say,  \"Identify one  trait  that  makes  you  feel  good  about who  you  are. your  laugh,  your  smile,  your  ability  to listen,  or  the  sound  of  your  voice. Take  a  moment  and  give  thanks  for  your small  goodness  and  for  the  potential love  of  others. It's  so  beautiful.  The  next  time  you exhibit  this  goodness,  notice  how who  you  are  affects  others.  So,  so  one of  the  things  about  all  my  writing  is that  like  the  bee,  you  know,  the  bee doesn't  the  flower  doesn't  dream  of  the bee.  It  blossoms  and  the  bee  comes.  I didn't  know  that  when  I  started  that. And  and  this  is  where  over  time  I've discovered  that  the  creative  process  and the  introspective  process  are  really  the same  thing.  I  just  happen  to  write  it down. And  and  so  there  are  so  many  lessons  and one  of  them  which  is  again  the  sense that  we  don't  know.  So  for  anyone  by being  authentic  we  are  given  insights and  so  when  I  start  things  I  am following  what  is  real  or  troubling  or wondrous  or  confusing  for  me and  then  if  I  am  true  I'm  rewarded  with an  insight  and  that  of  course  is  the insight  of  that  whole  entry.  um  and  I didn't  know  that  and  then  so  now  that becomes  my  teacher and  so  this  is  how  we  can  give  our hearts  attention and  what  comes  by  being  real  gives  us clues  to  our  own  gifts  and  so  one  of  the things  that  that  reveals  about  a  kind  of like  a  law  if  you  will  of  uh  a  spiritual law  you  know  and  this  often  we  see  this with  first  love  you  know where  in  high",
  "and  what  comes  by  being  real  gives  us clues  to  our  own  gifts  and  so  one  of  the things  that  that  reveals  about  a  kind  of like  a  law  if  you  will  of  uh  a  spiritual law  you  know  and  this  often  we  see  this with  first  love  you  know where  in  high you  love  me  and  which  means  you  see something  in  me  I  haven't  yet  seen >> and  now  my  god  and  I  think  you've  got the  switch  to  my  light  I  can't  let  you out  of  my  sight  which  actually  is  very self-centered  but  nonetheless um  you  know  I'm  just  like  oh  my  god  I'm head  over  heels  and  you  know  and  what  we learn  over  time  is  the  greatest respectful  gift  we  can  give  to  someone who  loves  us  is  to  own  our  own  light you  saw  it  but  it's  my  switch and  I  see  it  in  you  and  it's  your  switch and  we  have  to  honor  that  in  each  other and  so  this  is  one  of  the  beautiful things  is  by  being  who  we  are  I  mean  we do  have  to  love  ourselves  first >> how  though would  you  invite  somebody  who  really wants  to  be  more  loving  of  themselves first  and  to  like  find  the  switch. >> So  with  all  the  things  we're  talking about,  I  would  always  try  to  come  down to  small  steps. >> Okay. >> And  so  one  is  um can  you  identify uh  and  spend  time  with one  thing  you  feel  good  about  yourself? Can >> can  you  give  me  an  example? >> You're  a  good  listener.  You're  a  good storyteller.  You're  good  at  uh  showing up  when  people  need  you. >> You're  good  at  asking  questions.  You're good  at  um  finding  the  missing  piece. You  know,  you're  you're  good  at  um  uh you  know,  it  could  be  a  thousand  things, but  something  little. And  then  to  pay  attention, not  just  that  you  feel  good  when  you  do it,  but  what  is  it  opening  in  you? what's  going  on. >> You  know,  I  always  encourage  people  to use  their  own  life  as  a  case  study.

  "you  know,  it  could  be  a  thousand  things, but  something  little. And  then  to  pay  attention, not  just  that  you  feel  good  when  you  do it,  but  what  is  it  opening  in  you? what's  going  on. >> You  know,  I  always  encourage  people  to use  their  own  life  as  a  case  study.  Just like  DNA,  everything's  embedded.  All  of biology  is  embedded  in  DNA.  Well,  in  our heart,  everything,  you  know,  when  we touch  something  real,  all  of  humanity  is embedded  in  there.  And  so  how  do  we  you know  so  if  I  am  good  at  um  listening  to a  friend what  does  that  tell  me  about  my  gift  of listening? >> How  do  I  then  listen  to  myself?  How  do  I take  that  listening and  apply  it  to  myself?  Not  to  achieve anything  but  to  grow  more  intimate with  who  I  am. And  once  we're  intimate  with  who  we  are, we  also  be  we  enter  our  kinship  with  all things. >> Why  does  it  begin with  being  intimate  with  yourself  before you  can  be  connected  to  everything  else? Do  you  see  what  I  mean?  Like  I >> So,  so  to  to  speak  that,  let  me  go  out  a little  bit.  And  you  know,  all  the traditions  speak  about  it,  but  I  really love  how  the  Hindu  tradition  speaks about  it.  And  so  we  all  have  heard  the term  namaste  or  namaste.  I  say  namaste that's  the  Brooklyn  way  of  saying  it.  Um but  um  uh  what  it  means  is  I  honor  keep to  keep  what  is  true  in  view  the  portion of  universal  spirit  that  resides  in  you. So  in  the  west  we  call  that  soul.  In  the east  they  call  it  atman  Buddha  nature. Christianity  calls  it  the  holy  ghost. Judaism  calls  it  Yahweh,  you  know,  I mean,  there's  a  thousand  names and  and  so  what  I  believe,  and  that's just  my  point  on  the  circle  in  the  Elder Council,  um,  is that  just  like  the  air  in  a  bluebird house  is  a  little  portion  of  the  sky. We  call  it  the  soul  here,  but  we  each carry  a  portion  of  universal  spirit",
  "just  my  point  on  the  circle  in  the  Elder Council,  um,  is that  just  like  the  air  in  a  bluebird house  is  a  little  portion  of  the  sky. We  call  it  the  soul  here,  but  we  each carry  a  portion  of  universal  spirit while  we're  here. So  to  become  intimate  with  that  allows us  to  be  the  inlet  or  the  conduit >> between  the  world  of  spirit  that's existed  forever >> and  going  to  the  grocery  store. And  so  the  heart  again  is  has  to  stay open,  has  to  stay  this  open  vessel between  all  of  time  and  all  of  life  and the  person  you  help  up  who  dropped  their groceries. And  that's  why  we  need  to  be  intimate with  our  own  nature  so  that  we  have access to  more.  There's  a  paradox  that  by knowing  who  I  am,  I  can  gain  access  to all  I  am  not. Now  I'll  give  you  a  very  personal example  that  really  when  my  father  uh was  toward  the  end  of  his  life  and  he lived  to  be  93  and  we  were  estranged  for many  years  uh  both  my  mother  and  father for  many  years  about  be  and  then  in  his 80s  we  reconnected  which  I  was  so grateful  for  and  um  he  was  a  master woodworker and  you  know  so  we  never  I  was  his firstborn  son  but  we  we  never  spoke  the same  language  although  I  learned  so  much about  creativity  from  him  didn't  know  he didn't  teach  it  but  by  watching  him  so at  the  end  of  his  life  he  had  had  a  a stroke  and  was  in  the  hospital  and  um  he could  speak  but  it  was  so  difficult  he just  didn't  try  and  so  I  found  myself  in a  very  busy  he  didn't  have  a  separate room  and  I  was  in  a  very  busy  hospital setting  and  beeping  and  EVs  and  clattery and  all  of  a  sudden  I'm  feeding  him applesauce  with  a  spoon and  it  was  sad  and  beautiful  and bittersweet  and",
  "a  very  busy  he  didn't  have  a  separate room  and  I  was  in  a  very  busy  hospital setting  and  beeping  and  EVs  and  clattery and  all  of  a  sudden  I'm  feeding  him applesauce  with  a  spoon and  it  was  sad  and  beautiful  and bittersweet  and all  of  a  sudden  it  was  my  whole  life  in that  was  putting  a  spoon  in  his  mouth without  hitting  his  teeth  and  he  was  uh you  know  getting  the  applesauce  and  I'm crying  and  um  and  there  we  are  and Again,  going  back  to  you  can't  prepare for  these  things,  but  the  because  my heart  was  open. All  of  a  sudden,  I  was  in  a  moment  of wonder. All  of  a  sudden,  not  because  I  was looking  for  it,  but  because  I  held nothing  back  and  I  gave  everything  to that  moment, I  suddenly  was  in  the  moment  of  every adult  child  who  ever  fed  a  dying  parent. >> And  I  wasn't  alone.  by  being  thoroughly who  I  was  called  to  by  love,  not  by  some exercise  or  because  oh,  I'll  try  that. No,  just all  of  a  sudden  I  tripped  into  this amazing  inexplicable  space  and  it's changed  how  I  think  about  resilience. I  think  another  form  of  resilience is  when  we  are  thoroughly  who  we  are.  We are.  So  if  I  feel  your  pain,  I  am  in suddenly  the  river  of  everyone  who  ever felt  pain. If  I  feel  your  wonder,  I'm  in  the  river of  everyone  who  ever  felt  wonder. And  by  being  who  we  are,  gaining  access to  the  kinship  of  all  things is  an  amazing  form  of  resilience. >> Yeah,  I'm  still  here. So,  yes,  I  have  a  passage.  Um,  April 26th,  the  way  is  hard  but  clear.  Though it  is  the  hardest  going,  the  way  is clear.  The  naturalist  and environmentalist  Kevin  Scribner  tells  us that  salmon  make  their  way  upstream  by bumping  repeatedly  into  blocked  pathways",
  "So,  yes,  I  have  a  passage.  Um,  April 26th,  the  way  is  hard  but  clear.  Though it  is  the  hardest  going,  the  way  is clear.  The  naturalist  and environmentalist  Kevin  Scribner  tells  us that  salmon  make  their  way  upstream  by bumping  repeatedly  into  blocked  pathways until  they  find  where  the  current  is strongest.  Somehow  they  know  that  the unimpeded  rush  of  water  means  there  is no  obstacle  there.  And  so  they  enter this  opening  fervently.  For  though  it  is the  hardest  going,  the  way  is  clear.  The lesson  here  is  as  unnerving  as  it  is helpful.  In  facing  both  inner  and  outer adversities,  the  passage  of  truth  comes at  us  with  a  powerful  momentum  because it  is  clear  and  unimpeded.  And  so  where we  sense  the  rush  of  truth  is  where  we must  give  our  all.  As  human  beings,  the blocked  pathways  of  our  journey  can  take on  many  forms.  And  whether  it  be  in avoiding  conflict  with  others  or  in  not taking  the  risk  to  love  or  in  not accepting  the  call  of  spirit  that  would have  us  participate  more  fully  in  our days,  it  is  often  easier  to  butt  up continually  against  these  blocked pathways  than  to  enter  fervently  the  one passage  that  is  so  powerfully  clear.  In this  regard,  salmon  innately  model  a healthy  persistence  by  showing  us  how  to keep  nosing  for  the  unimpeded  way,  and once  finding  it,  how  to  work  even  harder to  make  it  through.  Some  say  it  is easier  for  salmon  since  the  power  of their  drive  to  end  where  they  begin  is not  compromised  by  the  endless considerations  that  often  keep  us  from the  truth.  Still,  it  is  the  heart's capacity  to  rise  one  more  time  after falling  down,  no  matter  how  bruised  that ve  verifies  that  such  a  drive  lives  in us,  too.  Like  salmon,  our  way  depends not  just  on  facing  things  headon,  but  in moving  our  whole  being  through. >> Thank  you. I  love  that  passage  for  a  lot  of reasons,  but  uh  not  the  least  of  which because  I  love  fish  and  fishing  and  all the  above.  Um,  but  um,",
  ">> Thank  you. I  love  that  passage  for  a  lot  of reasons,  but  uh  not  the  least  of  which because  I  love  fish  and  fishing  and  all the  above.  Um,  but  um, it's  part  of  the  origin  story,  if  you will,  in  finding  some  of  this  work  and and  your  writing is  that  I  think  that  there  were there  were  a  lot  of  elements  of  what  was going  on  in  my  life  that  were  true.  Mhm. >> Um but  they  were  all  sort  of  in  that confluence  of  water  rushing,  if  you will,  and  me  not  seeking that  um where  the  water  was  flowing  the  hardest, if  you  will.  Um,  so  when  I  read  that,  it just  speaks  to um,  not  only  maybe  some  of  the breakthroughs  that  I  had  for  myself,  but also  just  I'm  often  sharing  this  work with  other  men  who  are often  um, working  as  hard  as  they  can. >> Yeah. >> And  feeling  like they  are trying  to  nose  their  way  through  uh  the tough  stuff,  but you  know,  it's  not  when  you're  in  the middle  of  it,  certainly  for  the  salmon in  the  middle  of  the  river,  like  it's not  always  that  uh  it's  not  always  that apparent.  And >> of  course,  a  lot  easier  to  sit  in  the Yeti. >> Yeah.  and  and  catch  your  breath  and  then then  really  go  for  it.  And  so  um  this  is a  lot  of  what  I  find  myself  in conversation  about  is  finding  that  at least  discussing  what  could  be  true. >> Yeah. >> And  then  trying  to  inch  ourselves towards  that  rushing  water.",
  "then  really  go  for  it.  And  so  um  this  is a  lot  of  what  I  find  myself  in conversation  about  is  finding  that  at least  discussing  what  could  be  true. >> Yeah. >> And  then  trying  to  inch  ourselves towards  that  rushing  water. >> Well,  thank  you.  And  I  I  I  also  feel it's  important  that  in  facing these  openings  that  we  can't  do  it  alone and  we  don't  have  to  do  it  all  at  once. >> Like  I  may  find  like  oh  there  it  is  but I  don't  know  if  I  can  do  it  today. And  um  but  I  think  it  is  and  and  you know  for  me  I  I  I  think  my  native  the language  I  was  born  with  was  metaphor and  and  and  so  I've  always  seen  things in  looking  at  things  and  and  then  work to  find  out  what  the  teaching  is  and  and in  that  one  you  know  I  think  it  also speaks  to  how we're  awfully  h  often  humbled  into letting  go  of  where  we  think  we're going.  H I  wanted  to  dig  more  into  that  essay, Chris,  because >> when  you  read  it  as  the  salmon  and  if you've  ever  seen  salmon  swimming upstream  and  they're  leaping  up  with  the water  leaping  up  and  they're  efforting their  way,  I  think  if  I  had  to  guess why  there's  so  much  emotion, it's  that  often  times  where  the  water  is rushing, you  are  actively resisting  going  there.  Whether  it's ending  the  relationship  or  admitting  to yourself  that  you're  not  happy  or  it  is getting  sober  or  it's deciding  that you  want  to  have  a  deeper  spiritual experience that  you >> all  of  the  above. >> Just  do  them  all  at  once.  but  that  you know  and  you  feel  the  pull, but  you  spend  for  many  of  us  years  if not  decades  of  your  life  bumping  against the  rock,  feeling  the  pull  and  scared  to turn  toward  it.  And  I  think  that's",
  ">> Just  do  them  all  at  once.  but  that  you know  and  you  feel  the  pull, but  you  spend  for  many  of  us  years  if not  decades  of  your  life  bumping  against the  rock,  feeling  the  pull  and  scared  to turn  toward  it.  And  I  think  that's when  you  get  this  lesson  and  you  get  it over  and  over  in  life  and  you  go,  \"Oh, >> of  course. Oh,  I  wish  I  would  have  made  that decision  five  years  ago  when  I  first felt  the  water  rushing  there,  but  I  was scared.  And  then  you  like  I  feel  like your  tears  because  you  sit  in  circle with  so  many  men  on  soul  degree  your retreat that  you  see  the  pain that  we  cause  ourselves  unknowingly because  we  are  scared  of  that  rushing water  and  scared  of  where  it's  leading. And  so  I'd  love  to  hear  is  that I  mean  I'm  just  throwing  it  into  the circle  here. >> I  mean  I  think  you  the  way  you  describe it  is  is  is  spot  on.  I  mean  it's if  you  take  the  the  salmon  out  of  it  I often  think  about  it  kind  of  like  you know  Superman  must  feel  right  before  he breaks  his  face  through  the  brick  wall and  sort  of  gets  to  the  other  side  if you  will.  But  that  is  where  the  most force  or  to  your  what  you  were  saying Melo  just  about  resistance  and  how  of course  resistance  pops  up  often  in  just fear  and >> well  if  I  go  back  to  what  you  said  Mark the  word  trust >> Yeah. >> is  follow  your  heart. >> Yeah.  And  a  lot  of  times  in  life that  rushing  current you  know  deep  down  is  where  your  heart is  leading. >> Well  and  so  let  me  so  you  know  and  I think  it  also  can  be  up  here  in  many ways  that  that  clear  rush  way.  It  can  be it  can  be  admitting  what  is  true. >> It  can  be  admitting  our  limitations. um  you  know  it  can  be  putting  down  a",
  ">> Well  and  so  let  me  so  you  know  and  I think  it  also  can  be  up  here  in  many ways  that  that  clear  rush  way.  It  can  be it  can  be  admitting  what  is  true. >> It  can  be  admitting  our  limitations. um  you  know  it  can  be  putting  down  a dream  that  turned  out  to  be  a  cocoon  for the  dream  we  didn't  see  coming. >> And  I  also  think  that  you  know  I  mean your  compassion  for  those  you  work  with is  is  so  touching  and  it  challenges  us um that  we  can't  rob  anyone  of  their journey and  and  all  we  can  do  is  is  help  them.  I mean,  certainly  if  you  fall  down,  I  can help  you  up.  If  you're  bleeding,  I  can get  a  band-aid  or  call  the  doctor.  But inwardly, >> this  is  what  compassion  really  means. The  word  literally  means  to  be  with.  And so  to  be  with  you  means  I  agree  to  feel your  pain. I  agree  to  feel  your  joy,  but  I  can't. This  is  another  example  of  like  no  one can  live  your  life,  but  we  can't  do  it alone.  You  know,  one  of  the  things  in our  world  that  that  that  that's  that  we suffer  in  the  modern  world,  especially in  the  west,  is,  you  know,  we  feel  like we're  entitled to  a  stressfree uh  conflictfree, sensationfree  existence.  Well,  that's death. You  know,  if  we're  here,  the  full  what we  learn  from  is  the  full  range  of  being human,  which  includes  all  of  it.  And  so, you  know,  to  follow  your  heart  and  trust that  you'll  feel  things  and  you  may  get nicked  and  you  may  break  a  leg  or  you may  break  your  heart,  but  the  portion  of universal  spirit  that  you're  blessed  to carry  is  stronger and  more  whole and  will  carry  you  through  it. And  also  the  humbling  thing  to  always ask  for  help. >> Is  there  something  that  you  say  to yourself  when  you  are  standing  before one  of  those  walls  of  fire  in  life? >> You  know  there  are  cloudy  days  but  the",
  "and  will  carry  you  through  it. And  also  the  humbling  thing  to  always ask  for  help. >> Is  there  something  that  you  say  to yourself  when  you  are  standing  before one  of  those  walls  of  fire  in  life? >> You  know  there  are  cloudy  days  but  the sun  never  stops  shining. That  doesn't  mean  that  when  you're  under a  cloud  and  it's  stor  that's  real.  It's wet.  It's  damp.  You  get  cold  and  the stun  sun  doesn't  stop  shining.  And  we are  challenged  with  the  open  heart  to relate  to  both.  You  know  the  old  saying that  is  the  glass  half  full  or  half empty?  It's  always  both.  I  find  that such  a  useless  because  then  we  spend time  either  trying  to  be  in  the  full side  or  the  you  know  it's  always  both. And  what  we're  talking  about  is  the challenge  of  being  fully  here  is  how  do we  stay  in  relationship  to  both. >> I  always  say  when  people  say  that  it's really  about  the  glass >> and  you  can  fill  it  with  whatever  you choose >> and  you  can  empty  it  out >> which  forces  you  to  be  in  relation  to what's  in  it. >> That's  wonderful.  You  know,  if  the person  who's  listening,  Mark,  literally is  like,  I  just  want  to  look  at  life  the way  that  Mark  does, where  do  you  suggest  that  they  begin? >> Well,  the  first  thing  is,  um,  I encourage  you  not  to  look  at  life  as  I do,  but  to >> find  your  own  direct  connection  with life,  and  I'll  meet  you  there. And  this  is  so  important  uh  because  it's not  about  being  like  anybody  else. We  we  start  by  admitting  what  we  don't know.  We  start  by  opening  our  heart.  And there's  a  practice  the  word  admit. And  I  love  this  because  it  has  two meanings. Admit  means  to  declare  or  confess  what is  true. But  it  also  means  to  let  in. And  these  things  work  together.  The  more that  I  admit  what's  true,  the  more  I  let in. >> The  more  I  let  in,  the  more  I'm  capable of  admitting  what's  true.  So,  I  invite",
  "Admit  means  to  declare  or  confess  what is  true. But  it  also  means  to  let  in. And  these  things  work  together.  The  more that  I  admit  what's  true,  the  more  I  let in. >> The  more  I  let  in,  the  more  I'm  capable of  admitting  what's  true.  So,  I  invite people  to  start  by  admitting  what  is true.  You  know,  Mark,  I  I  love  that  you said  that  because  one  of  the  things  that I  believe  and  I  say  a  lot  is  that  all  it takes  to  change  your  life  for  the  better is  to  admit  that  how  your  life  is  right now  or  certain  aspects  of  it  doesn't make  you  particularly  happy.  That  just declaring  that  truth allows  in  a  different  possibility. I  think,  you  know,  in  one  of  my  poems,  I don't  have  it  with  me,  but  um  there's  a line,  you  know,  that  the  most  powerful thing  we  can  do  when  feeling  powerless is  admit  what  is  true. >> Because  so  often,  you  know,  I'm  afraid of  being  lonely  and  I  already  am. I'm  afraid  things  are  going  to  change. They've  already  changed.  And  often  the heart  knows  first  and  we  play  catchup. And  so  this  is  also  why  it's  so important  again  because  we're  human  and and  so  a  lot  of  the  things  we  talk  about about  being  blocked  or  being  um struggling  and  all  these  different  I think  of  them  not  as  deficiencies  but  as developmental  aspects  of  our  journey. >> What  do  you  do  when  you  wake  up  in  the morning?  I  mean,  I  wake  up,  I  get  out  of bed,  I  make  the  bed,  I  brush  my  teeth,  I go  for  a  walk,  I  read  a  a,  you  know, page  in  your  book  a  lot  of  mornings  to anchor  me,  but  what  do  you  do  first thing  in  the  morning? >> So,  the  first  thing  I  do,  and  this  opens up  a  wonderful  thing  I'd  love  to  talk  a little  bit  about.  So,  I'm  up,  my  wife Susan  is  kind  of  a  night  owl,  and  I'm  a morning  person,  which  actually  gives  us kind  of  good  alone  time  at  either  end  of the  day.  and  and  we  don't  have  kids  but a  very  spoiled  yellow  lab  Zuzu.  And  um so  the  first  thing  I  do  is  I  do  three simple  things  as  rituals  to  start  the day.  I  open  up  the  blinds  to  let  light in.",
  "morning  person,  which  actually  gives  us kind  of  good  alone  time  at  either  end  of the  day.  and  and  we  don't  have  kids  but a  very  spoiled  yellow  lab  Zuzu.  And  um so  the  first  thing  I  do  is  I  do  three simple  things  as  rituals  to  start  the day.  I  open  up  the  blinds  to  let  light in. >> I  take  care  of  something  living  by taking  care  of  feeding  Zuzu. And  then  I  do  something  for  someone  I love.  I  make  coffee  for  Susan  before  she wakes. So  I  invite  people  who  are  you  know  with us  and  watching  or  listening  to  think  of your  own  simple  rituals  because  when  I inhabit  them  fully  they  change  the  whole day.  So  this  brings  up  the  difference between  ritual  and  habit. So  when  I'm  present  to  it  I'm  letting the  light  in  caring  for  something  living and  doing  something  for  someone  I  love. And  that  aligns  me  going  back  to  the  the will  in  the  river.  That  aligns  me  um  for the  day. Now,  if  I'm  late  and  I  go,  \"Oh,  no.  I got  to  open  the  damn  blinds.  I  got  to feed  the  dog.  I  love  you,  but  uh well,  that  just  turned  into  a  habit.\" >> I  just  had  a  huge  breakthrough.  I realized  that  there's  something  I  do every  morning  that  I  didn't  even  realize was  part  of  the  morning.  I  literally when  I  open  my  eyes,  especially  when we're  home,  I  look  right  out  the  window and  I  because  we  don't  close  the  blind and  I  savor what  I  see.  And  I  had  never  thought about  the  grounding  ritual that  keeps  you  connected  to  something bigger  rather  than  the  things  that  I  do that  are  part  of  the  way  I  set  up  the day  that  do  feel  like  the  doing  versus the  being.  So  what  is  the  difference between  ritual  and  habit  in  your  words? Like  how  do  you  define  that? >> So  it's  being  present  and  openhearted. So,  the  thing  about  self-awareness,  and this  is  a  good  example  of  the  work  of self-awareness.  So,  I'm  rushing  through. I'm  late.  Oh,  I  got  to  open  the  damn blinds,  but  I  can  stop  and  go  back  and say,",
  "Like  how  do  you  define  that? >> So  it's  being  present  and  openhearted. So,  the  thing  about  self-awareness,  and this  is  a  good  example  of  the  work  of self-awareness.  So,  I'm  rushing  through. I'm  late.  Oh,  I  got  to  open  the  damn blinds,  but  I  can  stop  and  go  back  and say, I'm  going  to  be  present  and  make  it  a ritual  again. And  we  can  do  that  like  that. So,  it  led  me  to  look  to  find  the  origin of  the  word  ritual,  which  goes  back  to  a Sanskrit  word  RTA.  Arta  which  means  the hidden  order  of  the  universe. So  rituals that  we  make  ritual  by  being  present  and openhearted  reveal  the  hidden  order  of the  universe. >> And  it's  something  that  anyone  can  do even  in  the  middle  of  the  day.  If  you realize  you're  not  present, stop.  Okay,  no  judgment.  Back  up. Do  the  simple  thing  openheartedly. >> Can  you  give  us  a  couple  examples  of  a ritual  or  a  number  of  rituals  that  the person  listening  can  start  to  implement in  their  life  or  start  to  practice  in their  life  to  be  able  to  tap  into  this power? >> Yeah.  So  you  know  anything  that  you  do either  beginning  the  day,  ending  the  day or  during  the  day  just  just  choose  three simple  simple  thing.  It  may  be  watering the  flowers. Be  open  to  the  water  feeding  the  flowers as  they  grow  and  what  that  mirrors  in you  that  is  growing >> or  you  know  even  uh  you  know  dropping something  off  for  someone. You're  leaving  a  meal  for  someone. Anything  that  you  can  open  your  heart  to to  take  in  what  it  really  means. what  it  really  means.

  "You're  leaving  a  meal  for  someone. Anything  that  you  can  open  your  heart  to to  take  in  what  it  really  means. what  it  really  means.  And  so,  and  that become,  you  know,  it  could  be,  you  know, it  could  be  making  the  bed.  You  know,  I have  a  poem.  I  don't  have  it  with  me, but  it's  a  poem  where  the  first  part  of the  poem  I  go,  \"Oh,  I  got  to  make  the bed  every  day.  What's  the  point?  And  I got  to  pay  the  bills  and  I  h  you  know, and  I  and  and  then  in  the  poem,  a  friend calls  up  and  says,  you  know,  it's  such  a wonderful  day.  I  get  to  make  the  bed  and I  get  to  pay  the  bills. And  so  the  again  the  glass  is  both  half full  and  half  empty.  Being  human,  there will  be  days  when  we  feel  like  I  got  to do  this  again. But  by  staying  openhearted  and  admitting and  being  present, we  recover  the  miracle  of  it. >> And  the  the  goal  is  not  to  eliminate  one or  the  other  because  we're  human.  So, how  do  we  be  kind  to  ourselves  and  go, \"Yeah,  there  will  be  days  that  I'll  feel like  I  don't  believe  I  have  to  do  this one  more  time,  but  let  life  unfold  and tomorrow  you  say,  \"Oh  my  god,  I  get  to make  the  bed  and  wake  up  and  look  out the  window.\"  And  and  one  other  thing  I'd say  about  this  for  me  and  I  don't  you know  so  years  ago  I  would  always  do  the tedious  things  first and  save  the  the  really  sacred  things. Lord  I  got  all  that  done.  Nobody  taught me  to  do  that  way.  Somehow  I  did  that.  I had  it  all  ass  backwards. By  doing  what  matters  first.  It  changes the  entire  day. >> How?  because  my  lens,  my  aperture  of heart  and  mind  is  wider  and  deeper  and the  tasks  are  not  as  tedious.  Doesn't mean  I  enjoy,  you  know,  it's  not  like refraraming  that  something  tedious  is suddenly  wonderful,  but  it  takes  the edge  off  of  all  that.  I  really  want  to get  to  your  new  best-selling  book,  The Fifth  Season,  which  is  all  about creativity  in  the  second  half  of  life.",
  "the  tasks  are  not  as  tedious.

I  really  want  to get  to  your  new  best-selling  book,  The Fifth  Season,  which  is  all  about creativity  in  the  second  half  of  life. And  you  write  beautifully  in  this  book about  growing  older  with  purpose. >> And  I'd  love  to  have  you  talk  a  little bit  about  what  you've  learned  about purpose  and  creativity  as  you  have gotten  older. >> Yeah. >> That  you  wish  you  had  known  a  long  time ago.  And  look,  I  realize  that >> you  couldn't  have  known  it  a  long  time ago  because  you  now  know  it  based  on your  experience,  but >> Yeah.  And  and  one  of  the  things  I  I  find myself  saying  more  often  as  I  get  older is  whatever  it  is  like  you  know  I  wish I'd  known  this  5  years  ago  or  this  that is  that  um  we're  always  right  on  time. As  much  as  we  wanted  it  to  happen  we can't  you  can't  you  know  the  things  that I'm  writing  now  I  couldn't  have  written 20  years  ago  30  years  ago  because  I hadn't  experienced  what  I've  experienced there.  So  you  know  I  start  the  book  with a  a  metaphor  that  has  been  such  a teacher  for  me  and  it's  the  metaphor of  a  meteor. Now  as  a  meteor  comes  into  the  atmosph very  few  land  on  earth.  Most  of  them  are burned  up.  So  what  happens  is  a  meteor comes  into  the  atmosphere  and  as  it starts  to  flake  off  as  it  gets  brighter and  brighter  until  there's  nothing  left but  light.  I  think  this  is  a  good metaphor  for  the  journey  of  a  spirit  in a  body  and  time  on  earth  over  a lifetime. >> Now,  you  know,  we  don't  like  the  flaking off.  You  know,  my  back  surgery  was  a flaking  off.  You  know,  the  arthritis  I I'm  starting  to  feel  is  a  flaking  off, but  I  am  getting  brighter  and  brighter and  and  I'm  letting  that  light  that's coming  through  me  be  my  teacher.

  "and  and  I'm  letting  that  light  that's coming  through  me  be  my  teacher. So  I  think  and  so  one  of the  things  that happens  too  is  I  think  our  horizons shift. You  know  I'm  74.  I  sure  hope  I  live  to be  100.  Um  I  have,  you  know,  my  grand great  grandmother  lived  to  be  105.  Um and  my  grandmother  94.  So  you  know  I'm hoping.  But  regardless,  there's  more years  behind  than  ahead. And  so  the  horizon  shifts  in  that the  you  know  the  true  purpose  of  looking forward  or  back is  to  make  my  light  brighter.  Now so  this  brings  in  the  true  purpose  of memory. Memory  is  not  nostalgia. Nostalgia  is  wanting  to  go  back and  live  in  a  time  because  it  feels  like that  was  better  than  now.  M >> the  true  purpose  of  memory  I'm  finding is  if  there  was  a  time  in  my  past  where I  felt  a  certain  aliveness  or  a  wonder or  a  gift  or  love, can  I  revisit  that to  remember  what  it  feels  like to  trace  and  see  where  it  is  in  me  now? so  I  can  recover  it  now,  not  go  go  back to  then.  And  the  same  thing  with  dreams at  this  stage  of  life.  If  I'm  dreaming forward, it's  because  I'm  allowing  something  in me  that  wants  to  be  born  to  come  out and  how  do  I  take  that  and  see  where  it lives  in  me  now?  So  actually  this  though I'm  learning  this  later  in  life,  it's actually  very  helpful  practice  no matter what  age  you  are. If  there's  kind  of  one  message  that  you hope  someone  carries  with  them after  being  here  with  us and  really  taking  in",
  "I'm  learning  this  later  in  life,  it's actually  very  helpful  practice  no matter what  age  you  are. If  there's  kind  of  one  message  that  you hope  someone  carries  with  them after  being  here  with  us and  really  taking  in the  gifts  that  you've  given  us  today, the  things  that  you've  shared  with  us, what  do  you  hope the  person  carries  away  from  this conversation? Well,  um well  that  that  we  are  more  together  than alone >> and  that  we  need  each  other.  And  I  would also you  know  I  would  want  to  want  to  share maybe  two  notions  about  faith  in  a  and  a poem. >> Sure.  And  the  notions  about  faith, the  one  one  is  the  Buddhist  word  for faith  is  sadha. And  it  means  and  I  love  this  expression. It  means  resting  the  heart  in  what  is true. Resting  the  heart  in  what  is  true.  And  I think  that's  an  inner  definition  of  not faith  in  a  doctrine  or  a  tradition  or  a saint  or  a  sage,  but  functional  faith. And  all  the  things  we've  been  talking about,  opening,  admitting,  opening  our heart,  you  know,  ritual  versus  habit, all  of  these  things,  courage,  surrender, there  are  ways  to  rest  the  heart  in  what is  true. And  that  lets  us  stand  by  our  core. >> And  the  outer  sense  of  faith,  functional faith  is  I  refer  to  Paul  Tillik  who  was a  Protestant  theologian  and  he  said faith  is  an  act  of  ultimate  concern. I  love  that.  So  what  I  love  about  both of  those  is  by  resting  our  heart  in  what is  true, what's  in  the  heart  comes  out  through the  hands  in  the  world. So,  how  do  we  practice  personally resting  our  heart  in  what  is  true  and giving  ourselves  to  acts  of  ultimate concern? And  I  think  those  are  two  wonderful practices  to  devote  ourselves  to.  Um,",

And  I  think  those  are  two  wonderful practices  to  devote  ourselves  to.  Um, so  the  poem  I'd  love  to  end  with  is  one of  my  poems  called  Freefall. If  you  have  one  hour  of  air  and  many hours  to  go,  you  must  breathe  slowly. If  you  have  one  arm's  length  and  many things  to  care  for,  you  must  give freely. If  you  have  one  chance  to  know  God  and many  doubts,  you  must  set  your  heart  on fire. We  are  blessed.  Each  day  is  a  chance.  We have  two  arms.  Fear  wastes  air. >> Mark  Neapo,  what  are  your  parting  words? You  know,  my  my  parting  words  is  that  uh life  is more  than  anything  we  could  dream  of if  we  truly uh  meet  each  other  and  meet  ourselves right  here,  right  now. >> Well,  I  want  to  thank  you  for  teaching me  how  to  do  that.  and  I  want  to  thank you  for  getting  on  a  plane  and  coming here  to  our  studios  in  Boston  and sharing  everything  that  you  did.  It  has been  a  real  honor  to  finally  meet  you and  I  am  so  excited  by  the  ripple  of positive  change  and  consciousness that  will  spread  around  the  world  in ways  that  we  will  never  know  because  of the  person  that  is  listening  today  who shares  this  experience  with  people  that they  deeply  care  about.  So,  I  want  to thank  you. >> Oh,  thank  you. >> From  the  bottom  of  my  heart  for  making  a huge  difference  in  my  life.  I  want  to thank  you,  Chris.",

And  as  your  friend,  I  wanted  to  be sure  to  tell  you  in  case  nobody  else does  today,  that  I  love  you  and  I believe  in  you.  and  your  ability  to create  a  better  life.  And  opening yourself  up  to  the  magic  of  life  itself, that's  certainly  going  to  help  you create  a  better  life.  And  I  really  want that  for  you.  So,  that's  all  I  got  to say  cuz  I  think  I  got  to  go  cry  or  read a  Mark  Nepo  passage.  Uh,  but  I'll  be waiting  for  you  in  the  next  episode. I'll  be  there  to  welcome  you  in  the moment  you  hit  play.  I'll  see  you  there. And  thank  you  for  watching  all  the  way to  the  end.  And  you're  going  to  love this  next  video.  And  I'll  be  waiting  to welcome  you  in  the  moment  you  hit  play."
