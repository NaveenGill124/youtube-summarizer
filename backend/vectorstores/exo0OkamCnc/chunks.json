  "People  don't  want  perfect,  they  want authentic. People  don't  want  flawless,  they  want vulnerable. People  don't  want  polished,  they  want real.  People  don't  want  the  highlight reel,  they  want  the  human  behind  it. People  don't  want  performance. They  want  presence.  People  don't  want someone  who  has  it  all  together.  They want  someone  who's  willing  to  figure  it out. Because  perfection  may  impress,  but vulnerability  connects. The  number  one  health  and  wellness podcast, J  Shetty. J  Shetty, the  one,  the  only  J  Shetty. Hey  everyone,  it's  J  Shetty.  Welcome back  to  OnPurpose. Today's  episode  is  all  about  what  to  do when  no  one  believes  in  you  or  supports you.  The  sad  truth  is  I  hear  this wherever  I  am  in  the  world.  When  I'm traveling,  when  I'm  meeting  people,  when I'm  connecting,  one  of  the  top  things  I hear  is,  \"Jay,  the  people  around  me don't  believe  in  me.  The  people  around me  don't  support  me.  The  people  around me  don't  encourage  me.  Actually,  I'm scared  that  if  I  launch  my  company,  if  I start  my  podcast,  if  I  write  my  book,  if I  build  my  business,  the  people  around me  are  going  to  tear  it  down  before  I even  have  the  chance  to  build  it  up.\" And  a  lot  of  us  are  walking  through  life feeling  alone.  Maybe  you've  actually felt  disconnected  from  your  community. Maybe  you  felt  isolated  where  you  think, \"Why  does  no  one  help  me?  Why  does  no one  believe  in  me?  Why  does  no  one support  me?\"  If  you've  ever  felt  any  of those  things  and  you're  struggling  with that  self-belief,  that  self-doubt,  this episode  is  for  you.  Here's  the  first thing  I'm  going  to  say.  Stop  seeking support.  Start  creating  proof.  The science  says  we  experience  a  cognitive",
  "support  me?\"  If  you've  ever  felt  any  of those  things  and  you're  struggling  with that  self-belief,  that  self-doubt,  this episode  is  for  you.  Here's  the  first thing  I'm  going  to  say.  Stop  seeking support.  Start  creating  proof.  The science  says  we  experience  a  cognitive bias  called  the  false  consensus  effect. We  overestimate  how  much  people  will understand  or  agree  with  us.  Here's  why that's  counterintuitive. We  think  we  need  validation  before  we act.  But  in  reality,  people  often believe  in  you  after  you  prove  the  idea works,  not  before.  Imagine  this.  You're at  a  party.  You  say  something  you  think is  obviously  hilarious  or  smart  or interesting. Crickets.  No  one  laughs.  No  one's impressed.  You're  confused.  You  thought everyone  would  get  the  joke  because  in your  head  it  was  obvious.  It  made  sense. It  was  normal.  That  moment,  that  awkward silence,  that's  the  false  consensus effect  in  action.  The  false  consensus effect  is  a  cognitive  bias  where  we assume  that  other  people  think  the  way we  do  because  our  opinions  feel  obvious, logical,  even  universal  to  us. In  other  words,  if  I  believe  this,  most people  probably  do,  too.  Spoiler,  they don't.  And  science  proves  it.  The science  says  this  term  was  coined  by psychologists  Lee  Ross,  David  Green,  and Andrew  House  in  the  late  1970s.  In  one famous  study,  they  gave  people  a  tough moral  choice,  then  asked  them  to  guess what  others  would  choose.  Every  group believed  their  choice  was  the  majority option.  But  when  the  results  came  in, the  actual  opinions  were  split.  Nobody was  as  obviously  right  as  they  thought they  were.  Now,  why  does  this  matter? This  bias  shows  up  everywhere, especially  when  you're  building something  new.  You  assume  your  idea  is",
  "option.  But  when  the  results  came  in, the  actual  opinions  were  split.  Nobody was  as  obviously  right  as  they  thought they  were.  Now,  why  does  this  matter? This  bias  shows  up  everywhere, especially  when  you're  building something  new.  You  assume  your  idea  is clearly  brilliant,  but  others  don't  get it.  You  think  people  will  obviously support  you,  but  they  don't.  You  expect everyone  to  see  what  you  see,  but they're  not  in  your  head.  The  problem isn't  your  idea.  It's  that  you overestimated  how  obvious  it  would  be  to someone  who  hasn't  lived  your experiences. Here's  the  takeaway.  Just  because  it's clear  to  you  doesn't  mean  it's  clears  to others.  And  that's  not  a  flaw.  It's  a reminder.  You're  early.  You're  unique. You're  supposed  to  be  misunderstood  at first.  Instead  of  expecting  everyone  to agree,  get  curious,  ask  more,  listen better,  explain  smarter,  and  when  people don't  get  it,  don't  panic.  That's  not  a red  flag.  That's  the  beginning  of something  original.  Try  this  today.  Make something  small  and  tangible  that  shows your  idea  works.  A  sample,  a  deck,  a demo,  a  pilot,  a  mockup.  Stop  pitching. Start  proving.  Don't  try  to  convince people.  Show  them  what  they  didn't expect  to  see.  Don't  try  to  impress people.  Show  yourself  you  can  do  it. Don't  explain  your  vision  to  people committed  to  small  thinking.  Protect your  energy  and  prove  it  through  action. Don't  beg  to  be  understood.  Stay  focused long  enough  to  become  undeniable. Don't  wait  to  be  believed  in.  Become  the reason  they  rethink  what's  possible.  We have  to  start. We  have  to  begin.  We  have  to  get  going. People  won't  believe  in  you  before  you start.  They  might  not  even  believe  in",
  "Don't  wait  to  be  believed  in.  Become  the reason  they  rethink  what's  possible.  We have  to  start. We  have  to  begin.  We  have  to  get  going. People  won't  believe  in  you  before  you start.  They  might  not  even  believe  in you  after  you  start.  They  might  not  even believe  in  you  when  you  win  and  succeed. Just  start. Just  get  going.  Just  move. If  you  wait  for  people  to  believe  in  you before  you  start,  you  could  wait forever. If  you  wish  people  supported  you  before you  start,  you'll  be  wishing  forever. And  if  you  want  someone  to  think  you're going  to  do  something  incredible  before you  start,  you'll  be  wanting  forever. Don't  wish,  want,  and  wait  your  way  into never  moving.  Make  that  change.  Make that  shift.  And  notice  how  your  life changes.  The  second  thing  you  have  to understand  is  rejection  is  usually protection. Studies  on  psychological  projection  show that  people  often  reject  others  ideas because  of  their  own  fears,  insecurities or  limitations. This  is  surprising  because  their  no  may have  nothing  to  do  with  your  idea,  your potential,  and  everything  to  do  with their  past  and  their  issues. The  reason  someone  says  no  to  you  is more  likely  that  someone  said  no  to them. The  reason  someone  rejects  your  idea  is because  they  rejected  their  own. The  reason  someone doesn't  think  you're  going  to  make  it  is because  they  didn't  have  someone  who believed  in  them.  Their  projection  is not  a  prediction  of  your  potential. It  is  simply  a  mirror  of  their  past. Don't  let  someone's  projection become  a  prediction  for  your  future.  You",
  "because  they  didn't  have  someone  who believed  in  them.  Their  projection  is not  a  prediction  of  your  potential. It  is  simply  a  mirror  of  their  past. Don't  let  someone's  projection become  a  prediction  for  your  future.  You don't  have  to  do  that.  and  recognize maybe  they  wanted  to  quit  their  job  at one  point  and  they  couldn't.  Maybe  they wanted  to  start  an  app  at  one  point  and they  didn't.  Maybe  they  had  an  idea  and someone  told  them  not  to  do  it.  They're simply  reflecting  what  was  projected onto  them  onto  you.  We  don't  have  to reflect  it  back.  Try  this  today.  Next time  someone  doubts  you,  don't internalize  it.  Ask  yourself,  is  this about  me  or  about  what  they've  told themselves? People  will  project  their  limits  onto your  vision. Don't  let  people  break  your  dreams  when they  haven't  even  built  theirs. Don't  let  people  who  haven't  done  it create  doubts  for  you. Don't  take  feedback  from  someone  living a  life  you  don't  want.  Don't  confuse loud  opinions  with  lived  experience. Don't  take  direction  from  someone  who's never  moved. They're  not  wrong  or  bad.  They're  just trying  to  protect  you.  But  don't  project that  fear  onto  yourself.  A  lot  of  the times  when  I've  shared  risks  I  wanted  to take  and  had  family  members  or  friends tell  me  that  it  wasn't  going  to  happen, I  realized  they  just  wanted  me  to  be safe.  I  remember  when  I  wanted  to  quit my  career  and  potentially  pursue  some post-graduate  study  and  everyone  around me  said,  \"Jay,  well,  how  will  you  pay your  bills?  How  will  you  pay  for  your wedding?  How  will  you  take  care  of  your future?\"  Those  were  not  signs  that  I shouldn't  do  it.  Those  were  just reminders  that  they  valued  those  things. They  were  showing  me  they  valued security,  they  valued  safety,  and  they valued  stability.  And  those  are  not  bad values.  People  are  not  being  mean.",
  "future?\"  Those  were  not  signs  that  I shouldn't  do  it.  Those  were  just reminders  that  they  valued  those  things. They  were  showing  me  they  valued security,  they  valued  safety,  and  they valued  stability.  And  those  are  not  bad values.  People  are  not  being  mean. They're  simply  sharing  what  they  care about.  And  it's  your  job  to  decide whether  you  care  about  those  things  or whether  you  don't.  Sarah  Blakeley,  the founder  of  Spanx,  didn't  tell  her  family about  what  she  was  building  because  she didn't  want  to  hear  that  opinion.  And that's  something  I'd  encourage  you  to  do as  well.  Too  many  of  us  share  our  ideas with  too  many  people.  We  want  everyone to  get  around  us.  We  want  the  validation and  the  approval.  And  what  does  that  do? It  does  two  things.  The  first  is  it opens  you  up  to  lots  of  feedback  from people  who  don't  understand  that industry,  understand  that  business,  or understand  that  area.  You've  opened yourself  up  to  everyone's  emotional baggage.  That  was  your  choice.  And  the second  thing  is  whether  they  support  you or  not,  you've  taken  energy  away  from the  decision.  I  learned  something  really important  when  I  was  in  the  monastery that  if  you  share  something  before  it's happened  with  someone  who  can't  help  you do  it,  you've  taken  away  50%  of  the energy  from  that  idea  because  you  have searched  for  validation  and  approval before  you've  even  put  in  the  work.  Put in  the  work  first. Don't  look  for  approval  before  you've put  in  the  work.  Don't  look  for validation  even  after  you've  put  in  the work  because  chances  are  you  won't  get it  both  times.  Get  it  from  yourself.  Do the  work  to  prove  what  you're  capable of.  Take  on  the  challenge  to  show  what's possible  for  you.  Number  three,  use doubt  as  a  focus  filter. According  to  the  challenge  stress  model, a  certain  amount  of  pressure  and resistance  can  increase  focus  and  drive. See,  this  is  why  it's  counterintuitive. We  think  support  makes  us  stronger,  but",
  "doubt  as  a  focus  filter. According  to  the  challenge  stress  model, a  certain  amount  of  pressure  and resistance  can  increase  focus  and  drive. See,  this  is  why  it's  counterintuitive. We  think  support  makes  us  stronger,  but actually  resistance  can  make  us  sharper. Use  the  no  as  a  tool  to  clarify  the  yes. Try  this  today.  List  every  reason  people said  your  idea  won't  work  and  build solutions  around  them.  Turn  every criticism  into  a  checklist. Doubt  doesn't  mean  stop.  It  means refine. Doubt  doesn't  mean  give  up.  It  means redefine. Doubt  doesn't  mean  this  is  the  end.  It means  start  again. Support  doesn't  always  make  you stronger. Sometimes  resistance  does. Support  doesn't  always  make  it  easier. Resistance  makes  it  sharper. Support  feels  good.  Resistance  shows  you what  you're  made  of.  Support  cheers  you on.  Resistance  dares  you  to  keep  going without  applause.  Support  says,  \"I believe  in  you.\"  Resistance  says,  \"Prove it  to  yourself.\" Support  can  carry  you.  But  resistance, it  builds  your  muscle. Don't  resent  the  resistance. Use  it.  Let  it  shape  your  focus,  sharpen your  edge,  and  remind  you.  If  you  can  do it  without  the  noise,  you're  ready  for the  stage.  When  we're  waiting,  and  I  see this  happen  to  so  many  people  when  I travel  and  speak  to  them,  we're  waiting for  the  stage.  We're  waiting  for  the invite  in  order  to  be  our  best  self,  not realizing  that  when  we  become  our  best self,  we  get  invited  onto  the  stage.  By the  way,  I  remember  this.  I  did  the  same thing  to  myself  for  years.  I  used  to think,  yes,  when  I  get  the  opportunity, and  then  I  realized  just  take  every opportunity.  I  remember  speaking  in",
  "for  the  stage.  We're  waiting  for  the invite  in  order  to  be  our  best  self,  not realizing  that  when  we  become  our  best self,  we  get  invited  onto  the  stage.  By the  way,  I  remember  this.  I  did  the  same thing  to  myself  for  years.  I  used  to think,  yes,  when  I  get  the  opportunity, and  then  I  realized  just  take  every opportunity.  I  remember  speaking  in rooms  not  much  bigger  than  the  one  I'm in  right  now.  Speaking  to  empty  rooms, no  one  there,  just  four  walls.  And  I would  practice  my  speech  as  if  it  was full  of  100  people.  And  now  when  I  have the  fortune  of  being  live  at  the  Greek theater  with  5,000  people, doing  an  event  recently  at  the  theater at  MSG  with  5,000  of  you  as  well,  I often  think  back  to  that  moment  when there  was  zero  to  five  people  in  a  room. And  the  reason  is  because  my  enthusiasm and  energy was  pretty  much  the  same.  What  I  mean  by that  is  if  you're  sad  that  only  10 people  watched  your  video, switch  it  to  10  people  watched  my  video. If  you're  sad  that  you  got  100  views, think  about  that  for  a  second.  When  have you  ever  had  100  people  turn  up  to  hear you  speak?  If  you're  not  happy  that  you only  have  10,000  followers,  ask yourself,  have  you  ever  even  seen  10,000 people  in  one  place  show  up  for  you? It's  when  we  become  grateful, thoughtful,  and  focused  on  the  growth that  we've  already  made  that  we  gain more  energy  for  the  next  phase.  When you're  climbing  a  mountain, there's  two  important  viewpoints.  One  is looking  up  and  ahead,  and  the  other  is looking  down  and  behind.  You  look  down to  see  how  far  you've  come,  and  you  look up  to  see  how  far  you  have  left  to  go. Both  of  those  viewpoints  are  important. When  you  look  down  as  to  how  far  you've come,  you  get  energy  to  move  forward. And  when  you  look  at  how  far  you  have left  to  go,  you  feel  grounded  and humbled  by  the  challenge.  If  you  only look  up,  you'll  feel  discouraged.  And  if you  only  look  down,  you'll  feel arrogant.  Ego  and  discouragement  are  two",
  "And  when  you  look  at  how  far  you  have left  to  go,  you  feel  grounded  and humbled  by  the  challenge.  If  you  only look  up,  you'll  feel  discouraged.  And  if you  only  look  down,  you'll  feel arrogant.  Ego  and  discouragement  are  two sides  of  the  same  coin. They'll  keep  you  trapped  and  stuck  and not  help  you  move  forward.  What  we actually  want  is  humility  and  proof. Humility  and  proof  become  the  best allies  for  a  lifelong  journey.  Number four,  build  a  belief  battery  from strangers. The  Ben  Franklin  effect  shows  that  when we  engage  with  others  in  small reciprocal  ways,  trust  builds  faster even  among  strangers.  It's  really surprising.  Your  biggest  supporters might  not  be  friends  and  family.  In fact,  research  shows  strangers  are  often more  likely  to  champion  new  ideas because  they're  not  attached  to  your past.  This  is  Adam  Grant's  research. Imagine  this.  You  post  your  new  business idea,  podcast,  or  personal  project online.  You're  nervous,  vulnerable, hoping  your  friends  and  family  will  hype it  up.  Instead,  silence.  No  comment  from your  cousin,  no  re-share  from  your closest  friend,  not  even  a  fire  emoji from  your  roommate.  Then  someone  you've never  met  DMs  you.  This  is  exactly  what I  needed.  Keep  going. Why  does  that  happen?  Because  here's  the truth.  The  people  closest  to  you  aren't always  the  ones  most  likely  to  support your  growth. The  people  closest  to  you  are  not  the most  likely  to  believe  in  you.  The people  closest  to  you  are  not  the  first to  cheer  for  you  because  it's  the strangers,  the  others  that  you  didn't know  that  actually  are  coming  from  a place  of  neutrality  to  remind  you  that what  you're  doing  matters.  According  to organizational  psychologist  Adam  Grant,",
  "people  closest  to  you  are  not  the  first to  cheer  for  you  because  it's  the strangers,  the  others  that  you  didn't know  that  actually  are  coming  from  a place  of  neutrality  to  remind  you  that what  you're  doing  matters.  According  to organizational  psychologist  Adam  Grant, strangers  are  more  likely  to  support  new ideas  than  friends  or  family  because they're  not  emotionally  tied  to  your past.  Here's  the  psychology  behind  it. Your  inner  circle  knows  your  before. They've  seen  your  doubts,  your  failed attempts,  your  unfinished  drafts.  So when  you  evolve,  they  subconsciously compare  it  to  who  you  used  to  be.  It's called  identity  anchoring.  They unconsciously  anchor  you  to  the  version they're  most  familiar  with.  Oh,  that's just  Sarah.  She  always  starts  things  but never  follows  through.  Or  they  look  at you  and  say  that's  not  like  you.  Or since  when  are  you  a  podcaster? They  don't  mean  to  limit  you,  but  their memory  of  your  past  gets  in  the  way  of their  belief  in  your  future.  Their memory  of  your  past  gets  in  the  way  of their  belief  in  your  future. But  you  don't  have  to  let  that  stop  you. There's  an  amazing  scene  in  the  movie The  Founder.  If  you've  not  seen  it,  it's the  story  of  Ray  Croc  and  how  he  built McDonald's  into  the  powerhouse  that  it is  today.  Now,  whatever  your  thoughts are  on  McDonald's,  it's  an  interesting story.  He's  sitting  at  a  table  at  a members  club  sharing  his  new  business idea  that  is  the  franchise  model  for McDonald's  and  all  of  his  friends  have seen  him  get  excited  and  enthusiastic about  so  many  businesses  and  failed  and they  list  them  off.  Rey  knows  this  is different.  He  feels  it's  different  but he  can't  convince  them.  He  has  to  show it.  He  has  to  prove  it.  He  has  to  go  and do  it  for  them  to  come  around. Meanwhile,  strangers,  they're  remating your  present.  They  don't  know  how  many times  you've  hesitated.  They  don't  care about  your  high  school  GPA,  your  failed blog,  or  your  awkward  first  try.  They see  your  work,  your  message,  your  energy",
  "he  can't  convince  them.  He  has  to  show it.  He  has  to  prove  it.  He  has  to  go  and do  it  for  them  to  come  around. Meanwhile,  strangers,  they're  remating your  present.  They  don't  know  how  many times  you've  hesitated.  They  don't  care about  your  high  school  GPA,  your  failed blog,  or  your  awkward  first  try.  They as  it  is,  not  as  it  was.  And  that  gives them  the  clarity  to  say,  \"This  deserves a  shot.\"  So,  here's  the  takeaway.  Don't be  discouraged  when  support  doesn't  come from  the  people  you  expected.  Be  proud you  showed  up  anyway.  And  remember,  your audience  might  not  come  from  your  past. It's  waiting  in  your  future.  So,  keep building.  Let  strangers  become supporters.  Let  your  results  rewrite your  story  and  let  the  people  who  used to  know  you  catch  up.  Because  often  the people  who  will  believe  in  your  next chapter  haven't  met  you  yet.  So  try  this today.  Find  three  people  online  doing what  you  want  to  do.  Comment,  share, message.  Start  building  belief  outside your  circle.  If  your  people  don't  see  it yet,  find  the  ones  who  already  live  it. Step  number  five,  create  before  your confident.  This  is  the  most  important step.  You  don't  become  confident  before you  start.  You  don't  become  confident before  you  try.  You  don't  become confident  before  you  fail.  You  don't become  confident  before  you  do  the thing.  The  science  shows  this  too.  It's called  the  competence  confidence  loop. The  competence  confidence  loop  shows that  action  builds  belief,  not  the  other way  around.  We  wait  to  feel  ready,  but confidence  is  a  result  of  experience, not  a  requirement  to  begin.  Choose  one microaction  that  represents  your  idea. Launch  the  first  draft,  post  the  first video,  offer  the  first  service. Confidence  doesn't  come  first. Commitment  does.  Now,  here's  the confidence  myth  no  one  talks  about. We've  been  sold  this  idea.  Once  I  feel confident,  then  I'll  start.  But  here's",
  "Launch  the  first  draft,  post  the  first video,  offer  the  first  service. Confidence  doesn't  come  first. Commitment  does.  Now,  here's  the confidence  myth  no  one  talks  about. We've  been  sold  this  idea.  Once  I  feel confident,  then  I'll  start.  But  here's what  psychology  proves.  That  mindset  is backwards.  According  to  Albert  Bandura, Stanford  psychologist  and  the  father  of self-efficacy  theory,  confidence  doesn't come  before  action.  It  comes  because  of it.  Now,  what  does  it  mean?  When  you take  action,  especially  on  something new,  you  build  competence,  a  sense  of  I can  do  this.  That  competence  creates evidence  and  your  brain  uses  that evidence  to  build  confidence.  So  every time  you  start  imperfectly,  awkwardly, messily,  you're  not  just  doing  the thing.  You're  training  your  belief  that you  can.  We  wait  for  confidence  like it's  a  permission  slip.  But  confidence is  more  like  a  side  effect  of  showing up.  People  think  public  speakers  are born  confident.  Nope.  Most  of  them  were just  the  first  ones  willing  to  bomb  and come  back.  They  earned  it  through  reps, not  readiness. Bur's  research  shows  that  self-efficacy, your  belief  in  your  ability  to  succeed, increases  when  you  have  small  wins. These  are  known  as  mastery  experiences. It  also  increases  when  you  see  others succeed.  Vicarious  experiences.  We  think seeing  others  succeed  means  we  have  less chance  of  succeeding.  Actually,  it's  the opposite.  When  you  see  others  succeed, it  gives  you  more  opportunity  to  succeed because  you  realize  it's  available.  I've had  so  many  of  my  friends  start  social media  channels,  podcasts,  YouTube channels,  and  it's  incredible  to  watch their  rise.  It's  incredible  to  see  them give  their  gift  to  the  world.  And  what I'm  encouraging  my  community  and  the people  around  me  to  do  is  say,  \"Hey, when  you  see  people,  celebrate  that success.\"  And  then,  of  course,  verbal encouragement.  Social  persuasion  helps as  well.  This  reduces  fear  and  anxiety through  exposure.  Confidence  doesn't",
  "give  their  gift  to  the  world.  And  what I'm  encouraging  my  community  and  the people  around  me  to  do  is  say,  \"Hey, when  you  see  people,  celebrate  that success.\"  And  then,  of  course,  verbal encouragement.  Social  persuasion  helps as  well.  This  reduces  fear  and  anxiety through  exposure.  Confidence  doesn't require  perfection.  It  requires evidence.  Try  this  today.  Instead  of asking,  \"Do  I  feel  confident  enough  to start?\"  ask,  \"What's  one  small  action  I can  take  to  build  proof  that  I  can  do this?\"  Send  the  email.  Record  the  first minute.  Write  the  first  sentence.  Show up  even  if  you're  shaking.  Remember, affirmations  don't  build  confidence. Likes  and  views  don't  build  confidence. Being  told  you're  great  doesn't  build confidence. Watching  motivational  videos  doesn't build  confidence.  There  are  only  three things  that  build  confidence. Choosing  discomfort  builds  confidence. Keeping  promises  to  yourself  builds confidence. And  building  competence  builds confidence.  Step  number  six,  make failure  public  strategically.  The science  shows  that  imagining  failure before  it  happens  actually  increases your  odds  of  success.  Also, vulnerability  builds  trust.  People support  you  when  they  see  the  risk you're  taking.  Instead  of  hiding  your risk  or  hiding  your  fear  of  failure, name  it,  own  it,  and  invite  people  into the  ride.  Here's  what  I  want  you  to  say. Here's  what  I'm  building.  Here's  what might  not  work.  I'm  doing  it  anyway. That  honesty  earns  respect.  Even  if people  still  don't  fully  get  the  vision. I  remember  when  I  started  my  journey,  I posted  on  Facebook  saying,  \"Hey,  I'm trying  this  experiment.  I'd  love  for  you to  join  the  journey.  If  you  want  to  be  a part  of  it,  great.  If  you  don't,  I totally  understand.\"  And  all  of  a sudden,  it  let  people  know  that  I  was launching  without  launching.  When  you",
  "I  remember  when  I  started  my  journey,  I posted  on  Facebook  saying,  \"Hey,  I'm trying  this  experiment.  I'd  love  for  you to  join  the  journey.  If  you  want  to  be  a part  of  it,  great.  If  you  don't,  I totally  understand.\"  And  all  of  a sudden,  it  let  people  know  that  I  was launching  without  launching.  When  you kind  of  drum  up  this  buildup  to  this  big launch,  it  almost  feels  like  too  much pressure.  and  now  everyone's  expecting it  to  be  perfect  when  actually  when  you soft  launch  and  go,  \"Hey,  I'm  trying something.  I'm  giving  it  a  go.  I  hope  it does  well.\"  You  get  far  more  energy.  You don't  win  support  by  hiding  risk.  You earn  it  by  owning  it  because  people don't  want  perfect.  They  want  authentic. People  don't  want  flawless.  They  want vulnerable. People  don't  want  polished,  they  want real.  People  don't  want  the  highlight reel,  they  want  the  human  behind  it. People  don't  want  performance, they  want  presence.  People  don't  want someone  who  has  it  all  together.  They want  someone  who's  willing  to  figure  it out.  Because  perfection  may  impress,  but vulnerability connects.  It's  one  of  the  reasons  since my  first  videos  why  I  left  me  scuffing words,  why  I  may  not  perfect  every delivery  point,  why  you  may  see  me thinking  sometimes  in  interviews  and podcasts.  It's  because  it  was  real.  It actually  happened.  And  it's  why  I  do  a lot  of  things  without  a  lot  of  editing because  I  just  want  you  to  see  my thought  process.  I  want  you  to  hear  it as  I'm  discovering  an  idea  because that's  when  it's  powerful.  It's  that inception  moment  of  discovery,  of clarity,  of  connecting  that  resonates because  it's  real.  It's  heartto-he heart.  It's  human  to  human.  So  don't feel  that  you  have  to  be  a  perfect public  speaker  or  a  perfect  coder  or  a perfect  podcaster  or  whatever  it  is  to get  out  there.  Here's  number  seven. Don't  try  to  prove  people  wrong. Focus  on  proving  yourself  right.  People with  intrinsic  motivation  driven  by personal  meaning  outperform  those  with",
  "perfect  podcaster  or  whatever  it  is  to get  out  there.  Here's  number  seven. Don't  try  to  prove  people  wrong. Focus  on  proving  yourself  right.  People with  intrinsic  motivation  driven  by personal  meaning  outperform  those  with external  motivation  like  proving  someone wrong,  especially  in  the  long  term. Here's  why  it's  counterintuitive. Revenge  success  sounds  good,  but purpose-driven  success  lasts  longer. Revenge  ultimately  leads  to  resentment. resentment  of  what  you  focused  on, resentment  of  that  person,  and resentment  for  lost  time.  Purpose-driven success builds  confidence,  helps  you  understand your  potential, and  creates  passion.  So,  try  this  today. Write  a  mission  statement,  not  for others,  but  for  yourself.  You're  not doing  this  to  make  them  look  bad.  You're doing  this  to  find  what  you  care  about. You're  not  doing  this  to  prove  them wrong.  You're  doing  this  to  find something  that  you  like  doing.  You're not  doing  this  because  they  didn't believe  in  you.  You're  doing  this because  you  want  to  learn  to  believe  in yourself.  Keep  it  somewhere  visible. That's  your  anchor.  So,  if  no  one's clapping  for  your  idea  yet,  good.  That means  you're  early.  That  means  you're building  something  most  people  can't see.  Support  may  come  later,  but  your belief  has  to  come  first.  Because  at  the end  of  the  day,  if  you  don't  believe  in your  idea  enough  to  stand  alone  for  a while,  you're  not  going  to  be  ready  for the  crowd  that  comes  after.

If you  love  this  episode,  you'll  enjoy  my conversation  with  Megan  Trainer  on breaking  generational  trauma  and  how  to be  confident  from  the  inside  out.  My therapist  told  me,  \"Stand  in  the  mirror naked  for  5  minutes.\"  It  was  already tough  for  me  to  love  my  body,  but  after the  C-section  scar  with  all  the  stretch marks,  now  I'm  looking  at  myself  like I've  been  hacked.  But  day  three  when  I did  it,  I  was  like,  \"You  know what?  Her thighs  are  cute."
