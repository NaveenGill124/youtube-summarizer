  "[Music] If  someone  was  to  listen  to  our conversation,  today  and  apply  what you're  sharing,  what  would  be  the  number one  thing  they  would  overcome?  You  know, I  think  one  of  the  beautiful  things  that unfolds  and  blossoms  for  each  and  every one  of  us  when  we  learn  to  overcome  the fear  and  the  doubt  surrounding guidance  in  our  own  lives  is  this beautiful  knowing  unlocks  for  us  and we're  guided  into  the  most  magical experiences  that  we  couldn't  even  have dreamed  of.  There's  a  little  bit  of  a surrender  that  goes  on  to  the  trusting of  being  guided  by  our  teams  of  light  on the  other  side,  being  connected  to something  greater  than  ourselves  and being  part  of  that  journey  with  others. >> And  last  time  you  were  here  to  talk about  your  last  book,  Signs,  which  I absolutely  love  and  I  know  so  many  of  my friends  do.  You're  now  taking  a  step further  with  being  guided.  Talk  to  me about  the  difference  between  signs  and being  guided.  Yeah.  So,  it's  been  a journey  how  I've  been  guided  in  writing my  books.  You  know,  my  first  book,  The Light  Between  Us,  was  really  about  the truth  I  found  out  about  how  connected  we all  are  and  what  that  can  mean  for  our lives  and  the  lives  of  those  around  us. And  signs  was  really,  it  was  really  more like  enough  about  me.  This  is  about  you. I  don't  expect  anyone  to  believe  me  and what  I'm  saying  because  of  my experiences.  Go  and  try  this  for yourself.  create  this  language  with  your team  of  light  on  the  other  side.  Ask  for specific  signs.  You're  going  to  get them.  And  guide  is  is  what  happens  when",
  "And  signs  was  really,  it  was  really  more like  enough  about  me.  This  is  about  you. I  don't  expect  anyone  to  believe  me  and what  I'm  saying  because  of  my experiences.  Go  and  try  this  for yourself.  create  this  language  with  your team  of  light  on  the  other  side.  Ask  for specific  signs.  You're  going  to  get them.  And  guide  is  is  what  happens  when you  trust  those  signs.  When  you  follow that  path  that  those  signs  have  created for  you,  that's  when  the  magic  happens. That's  when  you  begin  to  not  only  be  in communication  with  your  team  of  light, you  are  led  on  a  journey  by  them. >> Now,  who  is  your  team  of  light?  How  do we  know  who  this  team  of  light  is?  How are  we  aware  of  who  they  are? >> Such  a  great  question.  We  all  have  a team  of  light.  This  is  what  I've  come  to understand  over  the  many  decades  that I've  done  this  work  and  connected  with the  other  side.  I  always  feel  we  have  a three-part  team  of  light.  The  first  part is  God  energy.  It's  this  force  of  love that's  inherent  in  us  that  connects  us to  each  other  that  guides  us  onto  our highest  path.  It's  love.  It's forgiveness.  It's  gratitude.  It's  all those  beautiful  emotions.  That's  how we're  guided.  The  second  part  of  our team  of  light,  and  everybody  has  this, is  what  I  refer  to  as  spirit  guides. Now,  throughout  time  in  history,  a  lot of  different  religions  have  referred  to this  concept  as  guardian  angels.  And that's  a  fine  word  to  use,  too.  I  just call  them  spirit  guides.  And  from  what  I see,  most  people  have  between  one  and three,  sometimes  more.  Um,  and  they're not  anybody  we  knew  this  lifetime. They're  just  advanced  angelic  beings that  our  souls  contracted  with  before  we came  here  to  Earth  School  to  be  mentored and  guided  by.  Because  here  in  Earth School,  we're  having  this  collective lesson  in  love.  And  the  only  purpose  is any  opportunity  we  have  to  give  our  love or  receive  other  people's  loves.  That's it.  Our  true  currency  is  kindness, forgiveness,  gratitude,  love.  And  our spirit  guides  will  help  us  navigate  this earth.  Some  people  are  really  in  tune with  their  guides  and  they'll  say,  \"Oh, I  know  what  my  guides  look  like.  I  had  a dream  of  one  or  I  had  a  vision  of  one.\" And  other  people  will  have  this  vague sense  of  somehow  being  nudged  sometimes or  watched  over,  but  they  won't  really understand  what  that  is.  And  both  are fine. >> And  then  the  third  part  of  our  team  of light  is  anyone  we  ever  loved  who's crossed  to  the  other  side.  Pets",
  "I  know  what  my  guides  look  like.  I  had  a dream  of  one  or  I  had  a  vision  of  one.\" And  other  people  will  have  this  vague sense  of  somehow  being  nudged  sometimes or  watched  over,  but  they  won't  really understand  what  that  is.  And  both  are fine. >> And  then  the  third  part  of  our  team  of light  is  anyone  we  ever  loved  who's crossed  to  the  other  side.  Pets included,  ancestors  we  may  have  never met  included.  They  all  guide  us  as  well and  they're  there  to  help  us  every single  day. >> So,  it's  this  really  beautiful collaborative  team  on  the  other  side that's  there  for  us.  We  just  need  to open  our  minds  and  our  hearts  more  to invite  that  guidance  in  and  to  also  hear it  when  we  receive  it  and  honor  it. >> I  love  that.  And  I  just  want  to  reflect on  that  for  a  second  for  myself.  And  I hope  when  I  do  that,  it  gives  you permission  at  home  or  whether  you're walking  or  whether  you're  driving  to  and from  work  or  cooking  right  now  while you're  listening  to  us.  I've  always  felt the  presence  of  God  energy  in  my  life. So  that  one  makes  sense  to  me.  And  I love  that  you  broadened  that  definition to  forgiveness,  love,  gratitude.  So  I think  we  all  know  what  that  feels  like where  we  feel  like  someone's  looking over  us.  There's  shelter.  there's pointing  in  the  right  direction  and  and sometimes  even  in  times  of  difficulty there's  someone  who's  helping  us  carry our  pain  and  whatever  else  it  may  be. The  second  one  really  stood  out  to  me because  I  think  this  year  I  had  a  really strong  experience  of  it.  So  my  monk teacher  who's  now  75  this  year  his friend  who  was  also  a  monk  and  they  were peers  passed  away maybe  around over  20  22  years  ago >> and  I  never  knew  his  friend.  So  my  monk teacher  spent  around  six  weeks  by  his friend's  bedside  as  he  had  cancer  and every  day  they  would  discuss  God.  They would  meditate  together.  They  would  pray together.  They  would  share  their reflections  and  realizations.  And  I would  always  hear  about  this  friend through  my  monk  teacher  and  through  our community.  I  never  met  him.  I  never  knew him.  I  never  saw  him  live.  He  passed away  before  I  got  engaged  with  the spiritual  community. But  I  always  felt  really  connected  to",
  "together.  They  would  share  their reflections  and  realizations.  And  I would  always  hear  about  this  friend through  my  monk  teacher  and  through  our community.  I  never  met  him.  I  never  knew him.  I  never  saw  him  live.  He  passed away  before  I  got  engaged  with  the spiritual  community. But  I  always  felt  really  connected  to his  work  and  his  work  was  translating ancient  wisdom  for  modern  times.  And  so for  me,  I  had  a  natural  affinity  to  his work. >> And  what  was  really  fascinating  was I  would  often pray  to  him  or  ask  him  for  guidance  on how  to  uh  serve  my  teacher  and  my spiritual  teacher,  which  is  common  in our  culture  of  how  to  how  we  connect with  our  teachers.  And  I  always  felt that  he'd  been  looking  over  me.  I  by  the way,  I've  never  had  a  I've  never  done  a psychic  medium  session.  I've  never communicated  with  him  directly.  I've never  I've  never  had  a  face  to  face  with him  in  any  sort  of  ethereal  form.  This is  purely  me  internally  feeling  all  of this.  And  what  was  really  really  special this  year  is  that  I  was  asked  to  give  a commencement  speech  at  a  university  and I  got  asked  by  Princeton  of  all universities  and  there  were  a  couple  of universities  that  we  were  talking  to  and I  wasn't  in  charge  of  choosing  the university.  was  the  university  that chose  me  and  he  went  to  Princeton >> and >> wow  what  a  sign >> so  and  after  all  these  years  of  kind  of being  and  I  couldn't  believe  it  and  then when  I  went  to  Princeton  I  didn't  even know  this  but  one  of  the  faculty  was showing  me  around  their  beautiful  church that  they  have  there  and  on  the  side  of the  church  they  have  significant  members or alumni  of  Princeton  that  have  not plaques  but  carvings  in  the  stone >> right >> and  as  we  were  walking  past.  I  saw  his name >> on  the  ch  and  it  was  right  there. >> And  it  was  just  one  of  those  moments that  for  me  I  couldn't  help  but  think that he'd  been  a  part  of  my  journey  up  until now  in  so  many  ways.  And  again,  like  I said,  I've  never  talked  to  him  directly. I've  never  worked  with  a  psychic  medium. I've  never  I've  never  had  a  interaction with  him  or  even  talked  to  my  teacher about  him.  I've  never  had  a  But  the exchange  is  there.  And  so  when  you  talk about  this  team  of  light  and  you  talk",
  "that he'd  been  a  part  of  my  journey  up  until now  in  so  many  ways.  And  again,  like  I said,  I've  never  talked  to  him  directly. I've  never  worked  with  a  psychic  medium. I've  never  I've  never  had  a  interaction with  him  or  even  talked  to  my  teacher about  him.  I've  never  had  a  But  the exchange  is  there.  And  so  when  you  talk about  this  team  of  light  and  you  talk about  people  that  we've  never  even  met that  we're  connected  to,  I  feel  so connected  to  him.  I  could  have  tears  in my  eyes  right  now.  Never  met  him  in  my entire  life.  Never  embraced  him,  never held  his  hand,  never  looked  him  in  the eyes  physically.  And  so  yeah,  I  I  love when  you  broke  down  the  team  of  light  as those  three  areas.  And  then  of  course, like  you  said,  pets,  people  we've  loved, which  I  think  makes  more  sense  to  people because  there's  people  we  feel  connected to.  I  love  that  description  of  the  team of  light.  It's  beautiful.  It's  really beautiful. >> I  love  this  story  and  I  love  how  guided you  were  to  make  that  speech  at Princeton  and  then  all  the  light  you  put into  the  world  by  doing  that.  And  I  find it  so  interesting  that  you  say,  \"I've never,  you  know,  had  a  psychic mediumship  reading.  I've  never  spoken  to him  directly  because  you  have  by  by directing  your  thoughts  to  him  by connecting  in  that  beautiful  heartfelt way  by  being  on  that  shared  mission  of bringing  light  and  meaning  into  people's journeys.  You  are  so  connected  with  him. I  love  that  you  called  upon  a  spirit guide  to  step  in  and  guide  you. >> Yeah.  Magical. >> Yeah.  Yeah.  No,  the  reason  why  I  was saying  I  haven't  is  because  I  want people  to  I  I  want  people  to  almost become  conscious  of  how  we're  doing  this anyway. >> Yes.  And  nobody  ever  needs  a  psychic medium.  That  is  my  big  message.  We  have that  doorway  within  us.  We  just  need  to recognize  that  it's  there. >> Honor  it,  trust  it,  and  leave  it  open, which  is  how  you  live  your  life. >> And  look  at  the  beautiful  path  you're guided  on  and  all  the  light  you  bring  to so  many  people  by  honoring  that  truth. >> Yeah.  I  I  just  I've  always  believed  that we  can  be  mentored  by  people  we've  never met.  And  I've  spent  a  lot  of  my  life studying  other  people's  lives  that  I've admired,  whether  it  was  Martin  Luther King,  whether  it  was  Malcolm  X,  Steve Jobs,  people  I've  never  met  and  never had  access  to.  And  I  feel  so  connected to  them  in  that  way  simply  through reading  what  they  wrote.  And  I  feel",
  "studying  other  people's  lives  that  I've admired,  whether  it  was  Martin  Luther King,  whether  it  was  Malcolm  X,  Steve Jobs,  people  I've  never  met  and  never had  access  to.  And  I  feel  so  connected to  them  in  that  way  simply  through reading  what  they  wrote.  And  I  feel people  are  so  alive  in  what  they  wrote and  what  they've  read  and  what  they heard.  And  I  think  we  take  for  granted today  we  live  in  a  world  where  you  can listen  to  a  podcast  with  anyone.  But  I truly  believe  that  if  someone  picks  up this  book,  they're  interacting  with  you and  then  they're  interacting  with  their team  of  light.  Like  there's  there's  just so  much  more  available  to  us  than  we think.  So  how  do  we  get  over  our  logical rational  brain  that  just  goes,  Jay, that's  just  a  crutch.  That's  just placebo.  That's  make  believe.  Your  story is  cute,  but  you  know,  it's  like whatever.  That  could  have  been  any university.  Princeton's  a  top university.  You  know,  someone  who  just kind  of  looks  at  it  through  skepticism and  cynicism. I'm  assuming  if  we're  skeptical  and cynical,  we  can't  connect.  But  maybe that's  the  beginning  of  the  path.  How  do we  start?  If  our  skeptical  and  cynical brain,  which  I  have  for  sure  as  well about  these  things,  what  do  we  do  with that?  Yeah,  I  think  this  is  such  a beautiful  and  important  question  because I  think  that  we  arrive  here  as  new  souls and  we  don't  really  have  language  yet. And  the  way  that  we're  communicating with  our  caregivers  and  feeling  our environment  is  all  through  our  intuitive and  psychic  senses.  We  are  sensing  and understanding  this  language  of  love  and unseen  energy.  But  then  we  start  formal schooling  and  we  literally  retrain  our brain  waves  from  all  different  parts  of our  brain  only  into  the  frontal  lobe. >> This  training  period  usually  happens between  age  5  and  seven.  So kindergarten,  first  grade,  second  grade. By  that  time,  98%  of  your  brain  wave activity  is  going  to  be  exclusively  in that  frontal  lobe.  So  what's  that frontal  lobe  in  charge  of?  And  what  have we  learned  there?  It's  in  charge  of analytical  thinking,  critical  thinking, math,  language  skills,  day-to-day living.  It's  in  charge  of  logic,  and it's  based  in  this  material  paradigm  of belief  that  if  you  can't  see  it  and touch  it,  it  doesn't  exist.  Now, truthfully,  energy  is  the  truth  of  our",
  "that  frontal  lobe.  So  what's  that frontal  lobe  in  charge  of?  And  what  have we  learned  there?  It's  in  charge  of analytical  thinking,  critical  thinking, math,  language  skills,  day-to-day living.  It's  in  charge  of  logic,  and it's  based  in  this  material  paradigm  of belief  that  if  you  can't  see  it  and touch  it,  it  doesn't  exist.  Now, truthfully,  energy  is  the  truth  of  our existence.  And  unseen  energy  all  around us  and  unseen  connection  and  unseen paths  and  guide  guidance,  that  is  the truth  of  what  we're  experiencing.  But  we are  so  trained  into  that  frontal  lobe. So  the  biggest  challenge  we're  going  to have  when  it  comes  to  embracing  this connection  with  our  team  of  light  and opening  to  it  and  really  receiving  that guidance  is  trusting  it. >> And  everybody  when  they  when  they  start creating  a  language  of  signs,  here's  the most  typical  thing  that  will  happen. They'll  ask  their  team  of  light  for  a very  specific  sign  to  let  them  know  I'm on  the  right  path  or  you're  with  me. Let's  say  they  ask  for  um  a  purple elephant.  They'll  get  the  purple elephant  and  then  their  monkey  mind  will get  in  a  wrestling  match  with  the spiritual  experience  and  they'll  hear this.  All  right,  I  don't  know  that  could have  been  a  coincidence. >> So  you'll  say  to  your  team  of  light, okay,  just  send  me  one  more  sign  so  I know  that  was  a  sign.  And  then  you  get the  second  sign  and  you  pause  and  you say,  \"Send  me  one  more  sign.  Send  me  one third  sign  and  then  I'll  totally  trust it.\"  You  get  the  third  sign  and  you're like,  \"Now  I  just  totally  believe  for about  a  week  and  then  you're  like,  \"Send me  another  sign.\"  And  I  think  this struggle  is  something  that  we  just  have to  live  with  because  I  don't  think  our brains  are  the  source  of  our consciousness,  nor  are  they  the  source of  our  connection  to  our  team  of  light or  each  other.  They're  more  like  dun caps  that  keep  us  from  remembering  that the  other  side  is  our  true  home  and  keep us  from  understanding  and  recognizing how  we're  all  part  of  each  other's journeys.  How  we're  not  really  separate from  one  another.  So,  it  is  a  real challenge.  But  what  I'm  going  to  say  is the  more  you  explore  it,  the  more  you just  keep  testing  it,  the  more  you're going  to  open  to  it.  And  when  you  get  to that  point  where  you  begin  to  truly trust  it, >> your  life  shifts  and  transforms.  And really,  that's  where  the  magic  happens. >> I  think  that's  what  it  is  for  me  in  my",
  "challenge.  But  what  I'm  going  to  say  is the  more  you  explore  it,  the  more  you just  keep  testing  it,  the  more  you're going  to  open  to  it.  And  when  you  get  to that  point  where  you  begin  to  truly trust  it, >> your  life  shifts  and  transforms.  And really,  that's  where  the  magic  happens. >> I  think  that's  what  it  is  for  me  in  my own  experience  of  whatever  the connectivity  is  for  my  for  me.  It's  it's moving  from  testing  to  trusting  and  at some  point  you  just  realize  I've  tested this  enough. I'm  aware  of  it  and  now  I  should  trust it  and  I  can  actually  now  look  at  when what  my  life  looks  like  when  I  trust  it and  when  I  don't. >> Yeah. >> So  now  I'm  no  longer  testing  it.  I'm actually  just  looking  at  my  life  going, \"Okay,  I  made  this  decision.  I  was  not trusting  myself.  I  made  it  based  on  pros and  cons  and  advantages  and disadvantages  and  I  didn't  feel  anything or  I  even  knew  I  didn't  feel  it  and  I still  said  yes  and  now  look  at  where  it went.\"  But  here  I  was  actually  clear  and I  trusted  it.  So  I  don't  even  need  to test  it  anymore.  I  can  actually  see  the difference  between  not  trusting  and trusting.  And  that  becomes  really  clear to  me.  And  I  feel  like  in  the  last  few years  I've  made  so  many  decisions  where I  haven't  trusted  because  I  thought there  were  better  things  to  follow  or people  who  knew  more  or  whatever  it  may have  been.  And  then  there  are  times  when I've  fully  trusted.  And  I've  always  been happier  and  more  satisfied  when  I've fully  trusted.  Always.  And  and  when  I say  trusted,  and  I  want  to  help  people with  this,  and  I  want  you  to  help  people with  this.  Let's  say  someone's  listening to  us  right  now,  Laureline,  and  they they're  stuck  in  a  bad  relationship. They're  stuck  in  a  bad  career  that  they hate.  They're  in  a  difficult  situation, and  they're  almost  looking  up  going, \"Why  me?  Why  is  this  happening  to  me? Like,  what's  what's  wrong  with  me?\" the  the  questions  that  we  naturally  ask when  we're  in  positions  of  pain  and stress  and  pressure. How  does  that  person  open  up  for guidance  or  trusting  themselves  when they  feel  that  trusting  themselves  is what's  got  them  into  this  mess?  Oh,  wow. These  are  such  this  is  such  a  wonderful question.  First,  let  me  say  I  love  the almost  reflection  you've  done  in  your own  life  to  think,  let  me  look  back  at the  choices  I  made  that  were  not intuitively  based,  but  logically  based and  how  that  turned  out  for  me  versus",
  "they  feel  that  trusting  themselves  is what's  got  them  into  this  mess?  Oh,  wow. These  are  such  this  is  such  a  wonderful question.

I  think  that's so  important  because  intuition, connection,  guidance,  it's  also  often counterintuitive  logically  to  what  we think  we  should  be  doing  in  a  logical way.  So,  that's  that's  the  first  part  of that.  But  you're  really  bringing  up  like self-doubt  and  this  sense  that  we  all get  sometimes  that  I'm  alone  in  the world.  I'm  not  guided.  I'm  not  connected to  anything  because  if  I  were,  I wouldn't  be  where  I  am  right  now.  The most  powerful  thing  that  I  have  seen when  I  have  read  for  people  or  gone  into their  energy  field  is  so  many  times people  are  going  through  very  dark experiences  or  they're  feeling  very overwhelmed  and  confused.  But  what  I  see about  their  life  path  is  that  they  are completely  on  path  that  this  is  some experience  that  their  soul  signed  up for.  Whether  it's  because  it's  a  lesson for  them  or  they're  a  catalyst  as  a lesson  for  someone  else  or  there's something  greater  down  the  road  that  it will  lead  them  to  that  they  can't  see  in the  moment.  They're  blinded  to  it.  So,  I think  a  mistake  we  make  is  that  when things  get  really  difficult  or  we  feel really  lost,  we  automatically  think we've  taken  a  wrong  turn  or  we're  not connected  to  this  beautiful  team  of light.  The  most  important  thing  we  can do  in  those  moments  is  set  an  intention to  be  guided.  We  can  surrender  to  the other  side.  We  can  say,  \"Look,  I've tried  everything  I  can  in  this direction,  and  I  thought  this  was  the answer,  but  I'm  realizing  I'm  feeling lost.  I  need  you  to  guide  me.  I  need  you to  show  me.  I  need  you  to  bring  the people  into  my  path  who  I'm  meant  to meet,  maybe  the  experiences  I'm  meant  to have.\"  And  you  can  certainly  create  a language  of  signs  where  you  ask  for  a song,  a  phrase,  a  number  sequence,  or some  sort  of  creature.

  "to  show  me.  I  need  you  to  bring  the people  into  my  path  who  I'm  meant  to meet,  maybe  the  experiences  I'm  meant  to have.\"  And  you  can  certainly  create  a language  of  signs  where  you  ask  for  a song,  a  phrase,  a  number  sequence,  or some  sort  of  creature.  You  also  need  to just  be  open  to  the  guidance  you're already  been  given.  So,  I  think  it  can really  be  a  remarkable  tool  when  we're in  our  darkest  times  because  nobody  is ever  alone.  The  truth  I  know  is  that  we are  all  so  beloved  and  so  guided  even when  we  think  we're  alone. >> And  I  think  surrendering  to  that  knowing or  that  truth  or  just  surrendering  to saying,  \"Help  me,  show  me,  guide  me,\"  is all  we  need  to  do.  I  think  it's  an  old religious  story  where  this  man  is  on  a boat  in  the  middle  of  the  ocean  and  his boat,  you  know,  is  about  to  capsize  and he's  on  top  of the  boat  asking  God  to save  him  because  he's  a  God-  centered man.  And  then  this  other  boat  comes  by and  they  say,  \"Hey,  we'll  save  you.  Come on  board.\"  He  goes,  \"No,  no,  no.  I'm  I'm waiting  for  God.  I've  got  God  saving me.\"  Like,  so  then  the  boat  goes  past and  then  this  helicopter  comes  and  goes, \"Hey,  we'll  save  you.\"  And  then  he  goes, \"No,  no,  I'm  waiting  for  God  to  save  me. Like,  don't  worry  about  it.  Just,  you know,  I'm  just  I'll  pray  to  God.  And then  the  helicopter  goes  by.  And  then the  plane  comes  by  and  the  same  thing has  happened.  And  then  he  dies.  And  then he  ends  up  in  heaven.  And  then  he  the first  thing  he  says  to  God  is  like,  God, well,  why  didn't  you  save  me?  Like obviously  all  I  I  love  you.  Like  I'm waiting  for  you  to  save  me.  And  God says,  \"Well,  first  I  sent  you  the  boat. Then  I  sent  you  the  helicopter,  then  I sent  you  the  plane.  Why  didn't  you  take one  of  those?  Like  what  was  wrong  with you?\"  And  I  and  I  feel  like  sometimes that's  what  signs  are  like,  that  they don't  always  come.  Talk  to  me  about signs  that  come  in  the  way  you  want. I.e.  I  want  to  see  a  particular  bird  or creature  or  pink  a  purple  elephant.  But what  about  the  signs  that  show  up  in  the way  you  didn't  ask  for  them?  Yeah.  It's a  it's  this  beautiful  co-  collaborative language.  So  while  we  can  certainly  ask for  specific  signs,  what  we  need  to recognize  is  signs  are  all  around  us  at all  times.  It's  this  language  that's created  also  by  your  team  of  light.  So, they're  going  to  put  all  sorts  of  signs on  your  path.  Pay  attention  to  license plates.

Pay  attention  to  license show  up  in  your  social  media  feeds.  Pay attention  to  people  who  are  placed  in your  path  to  experiences  that  are offered  to  you.  The  universe  is  giving us  invitations  all  the  time,  but  if  we don't  have  our  minds  and  our  hearts open,  we  miss  them, >> right?  So  I  think  so  often  we're  guided in  a  profound  way  that  we  miss  because we're  so  stuck  in  this  analytical  way  of thinking  in  this  materialistic  way  of thinking  that  we  miss  the  magic.  And  I think  the  story  you  just  shared illustrates  that  completely.  We're  so set  in  the  way  we  think  we're  going  to receive  it  or  exactly  what  we  think  we need  to  receive  that  we  miss  all  the beautiful  things  being  sent  our  way.  I think  too  it's  a  matter  of  setting  an intention  within  ourselves  where  we  say help  me  see  the  signs,  the  guidance,  the messages,  the  meaning  that  I  am  maybe missing  in  some  ways. >> How  do  we  how  do  we  know  the  difference between  our  intuition  and  our  mind? >> That's  such  a  great  question.  So,  here is  what  I  can  share  about  what  I've learned  about  intuition  versus  what we're  generating  in  our  own  minds,  which is  often,  you  know,  anxiety,  chattering talk.  It's  what,  you  know,  meditation teachers  call  the  monkey  mind  because  it never  stops  and  it  tells  you  a  story about  your  life  and  who  you  are  and what's  going  on  and  it's  often  very negative,  especially  to  yourself.  So, how  do  we  tell  the  difference  between that  and  when  we're  really  in  a  state  of deep  connection  or  receiving  information from  our  team  of  light  or  in  an intuitive  way?  Well,  here's  what  I've come  to  learn. Intuition, messages  from  the  other  side,  deep knowings,  it  never  comes  with  emotion. It  comes  very  neutrally.  It  will  arrive as  a  knowing.  That  is  a  term  called clear  cognissance,  which  means  clear knowing.  You  don't  know  how  you  know  it. It's  no  logical  way  you  could  possibly know  it,  but  you  know  it.  And  it  could",

And  it  could be  really  wonderful  information.  It could  say  something  like,  um,  tomorrow you're  going  to,  you  know,  have  this incredible  experience  and  meet  this person  who  is  one  of  your  soulmates,  but it  won't  come  with  any  sort  of  like,  oh my  gosh,  you  might  have  a  reaction  after that,  like,  oh  my  gosh,  tomorrow  I'm going  to  meet  this  amazing  person destined  for  my  path.  Or  you  might  get uh  this  knowing  this  download.  You  know, oftentimes  it's  referred  to  downloads. I've  heard  a  lot  of  creative  people  talk about  getting  downloads,  a  sense  of getting  information  from  somewhere outside  of  themselves,  right?  You'll  get a  download  that's  maybe  saying  like, \"Oh,  your  car's  going  to  break  down tomorrow.\"  But  it  won't  come  with negative  emotion.  You'll  receive  that information  and  then  you  might  react emotionally  like,  \"Oh,  no.\"  But  it  will come  neutally.  And  so  if  you're  in  a state  of  anxiety  and  fear  about  things, that  is  not  coming  from  your  team  of light.  That  is  not  coming  from  God energy.  It  is  not  coming  from  your guides.  It  is  not  coming  from  your  loved ones  who  are  also  guiding  you.  That's coming  from  that  frontal  lobe  monkey mind  that's  chattering.  And  I  think  it can  be  so  helpful  when  we  get  into  those moments  where  we  have  so  many  negative thoughts  coming  and  we're  so  anxious  to remind  ourselves  that  that  is  not  coming from  our  spiritual  self.  And  a  really easy  way  to  kind  of  reconnect,  I  think, with  our  spiritual  self  and  get  grounded in  our  own  light  and  reconnected  with our  team  of  light  is  through  simple breath  work.  The  other  sides  told  me  the the  moment  that  our  soul  really  attaches to  these  physical  bodies  is  the  moment we  take  our  first  breath.  The  moment  it leaves  is  with  our  last  breath.  So  just by  focusing  on  breathing  like  in  through your  nose  fully  and  slowly  and  out through  your  mouth  three  times,  you're going  to  get  in  that  state  of reconnection.  So  if  anybody  ever  has  a  a moment  where  they're  like,  \"Oh,  I'm feeling  this  thing.  Is  this  from  coming from  me  and  my  anxiety  or  is  this  a knowing  from  the  other  side?\"  Just  do the  little  breath  work  and  wait  and  see how  you  feel  in  the  moments  after.",

Whether it's  choosing  to  spend  a  quiet  night  in to  recharge  or  making  a  decision  that brings  you  closer  to  a  long-term  goal. Those  moments  of  intention  really matter.  And  when  it  comes  to  the  choices we  make  with  our  money,  that  same mindset  applies.  I've  learned  that saving  for  the  things  that  truly  matter, like  your  first  home  or  a  reliable  car, starts  with  small,  thoughtful  decisions. That's  why  I  appreciate  what  State  Farm is  doing  with  their  personal  price  plan. It  gives  you  the  power  to  personalize your  plan  and  create  an  affordable  price that  works  for  your  life.  You  can  bundle your  home  and  auto  insurance  in  a  way that  supports  your  journey  and  your goals.  Talk  to  a  State  Farm  agent  today to  learn  how  you  can  choose  to  bundle and  save  with  the  personal  price  plan. Like  a  good  neighbor,  State  Farm  is there.  Prices  are  based  on  rating  plans that  vary  by  state.  Coverage  options  are selected  by  the  customer.  Availability, amount  of  discounts  and  savings,  and eligibility  vary  by  state.  Like  you  were saying,  when  we're  scrolling  social media,  we're  just  feeling  envy, comparison, stress,  like  we're  not  really  there's not  a  space  for  knowing  because  it's clouded  and  so  noisy  in  all  of  these other  unhelpful,  unhealthy,  or  maybe they're  not  unhelpful  and  unhealthy. Maybe  they're  helpful  and  we're  not looking  at  them  right.  But  I  find  that the  mind  is  so  the  monkey  mind  is  the best  definition.  It's  just  jumping  from branch  to  branch  to  branch  to  branch  to branch  to  branch  to  branch  and  then you're  exhausted. >> Yeah. >> And  we've  lost  that  ability  to  stay still  and  and  hear  internally.  I  also think  that  we're  living  in  a  time  where we  think  all  the  right  answers  are outside  of  us.  So >> what  does  everyone  else  think  is  right? What  do  my  friends  think  is  right?  Do  my parents  think  this  is  good  for  me?  And  I think  a  lot  of  people  have  become dependent  on  thinking  well  if  my  parents",
  ">> And  we've  lost  that  ability  to  stay still  and  and  hear  internally.  I  also think  that  we're  living  in  a  time  where we  think  all  the  right  answers  are outside  of  us.  So >> what  does  everyone  else  think  is  right? What  do  my  friends  think  is  right?  Do  my parents  think  this  is  good  for  me?  And  I think  a  lot  of  people  have  become dependent  on  thinking  well  if  my  parents think  it's  good  for  me  or  if  my  family does  or  if  my  friend  do  then  it  is.  And so  we  don't  really  even  know  how  to start  trusting  ourselves  again. >> Yeah.  And  I  think  one  of the  most powerful  and  magical  things  we  can  do  on our  own  spiritual  journeys  here  is  to trust  that  knowing  that  light  that connection  we  have  within  ourselves.  And when  we  trust  that  it's  a  very  different feeling.  It's  a  It's  a  feeling  of  peace. It's  a  feeling  of  calm.  It's  a  feeling of  knowing.  And  it's  accessible  to  us.  I think  the  most  important  relationship  we ever  have  here  while  we're  on  Earth School  is  the  one  we  have  with ourselves.  M >> and  if  we  disconnect  from  our  truths  or what  we  have  as  our  knowing  in  terms  of what  our  highest  path  might  be  or  that that  pull  that  we  get  inside  sometimes where  something  lights  us  up  and  we  want to  we  want  to  do  that  or  we  want  to follow  that  but  then  our  monkey  mind says  no  that's  crazy  why  would  you  do that  or  you  can't  do  that  you've  got  all these  other  things  to  do  or  that's outside  the  norm  for  you  I  think  when  we trust  that  inner  voice  that  inner knowing  that  is  our  connection  to  our team  of  light.  That's  our  connection  to our  highest  self  and  that's  also  our connection  to  our  highest  path. >> So  it's  really  internal  work.  The doorway  is  within.  You  don't  need  anyone else  to  access  it  for  you.  You  just  need to  start  trusting  your  own  light, trusting  your  own  knowings  and  use  that as  your  inner  guidance,  as  your  inner compass. >> And  I  think  that  that's  fuzzy  for  people because  it's  almost  like  if  you've  done it  long  enough,  it's  become  clearer.  So you're  aware,  but  if  someone's  just starting  out,  I  imagine  they're  like, \"Well,  I  don't  know  if  this  is  trauma, if  this  is  the  past.\"  ask  like  let's  say someone's  dating  someone  and  there's  a part  of  them  that's  like  I'm  not  sure they're  the  right  person  but  they  don't know  if  that  feeling  is  them  wanting",
  "starting  out,  I  imagine  they're  like, \"Well,  I  don't  know  if  this  is  trauma, if  this  is  the  past.\"  ask  like  let's  say someone's  dating  someone  and  there's  a part  of  them  that's  like  I'm  not  sure they're  the  right  person  but  they  don't know  if  that  feeling  is  them  wanting chaos when  this  person  is  more  peaceful  or maybe  they  truly  don't  have  chemistry with  this  person  and  they're  wondering and  I  think  that's  where  people  get  lost where  it's  like  how  do  I  know  it's  the light  how  do  I  know  it's  the  inner  voice versus  all  these  thoughts  I'm  having what  can  you  do  to  help  people  right  now that  can  encourage  them  to  know  how  to connect  with  their  knowing  and  move  in that  direction. >> Yeah,  I  think  that's  such  a  great example,  right?  And  again,  it's  that that  inner  narrative  we  have  that questions  and  our  inner  narratives  are often  very  fear-based.  They're  often very  mean  to  ourselves,  too.  So,  if you're  having  these  thoughts  and  you  can recognize  that  they're  coming  from  a place  of  fear,  the  most  important  step is  to  pause  for  a  moment  and  then  talk over  the  thoughts  with  love.  So,  let's say  you're  having  thoughts  like,  I  don't know  if  I  can  trust  myself.  Am  I  in  this wrong  relationship?  I  don't  know  the answer.  Well,  maybe  you're  not  supposed to  know  right  now.  It's  a  journey  and you'll  know  and  you'll  arrive  at  that knowing  in  divine  timing.  So  what  you need  to  do  in  those  moments  is  in  your thoughts  talk  back  to  yourself  and  say actually I  am  a  spirit  in  a  human  body  having this  beautiful  experience  of  collective love  and  I'm  so  excited  to  be  open  to another  day  of  guidance.  I  trust  that I'm  in  connection  with  my  team  of  light and  I  trust  that  I'm  going  to  be  guided into  the  experiences  that  I  need  to  have to  grow  my  own  soul >> and  leave  it  because  you're  we're  all  on journeys  and  we're  not  supposed  to  have the  answers  right  away.  And  often  times we're  so  interconnected  with  other people's  journeys  that  we  might  be  there as  a  catalyst  for  theirs  or  they're there  as  a  lesson  for  us  or  it  goes  both ways.  We  can't  fast  forward  that.  If  we get  into  moments  where  we're  confused, that's  a  wonderful  opportunity  for  us  to get  really  grounded  in  our  own  light  and be  patient  and  wait  to  be  on  this",

We're  all  seekers.  And  if you're  having  a  moment  of  confusion where  you're  like,  I  don't  know.  I  don't know.  Remember  that  you're  a  seeker  and remember  that  there's  a  divine  timeline going  on  here  and  then  surrender  to that. >> Yeah.  I  found  for  me  three  simple  things that  have  helped  me  know  the  difference between  my  intuition  and  my  mind.  I found  that  my  mind  will  be  loud  and  my intuition  will  be  quiet. >> Yes. >> So  when  my  mind  wants  to  say  something to  me,  it  will  it  will  literally  shout it  at  me  like  this  was  how  it  was  meant to  be  done.  This  is  what  you  should  be doing.  What's  wrong  with  you?  It's really  loud.  Whereas  my  intuition  is quite  quiet  and  be  like  just  I  feel  this way.  I  think  this,  you  know,  it's  it's  a lot  more  still  and  peaceful.  I  find  that my  mind  is  more  directive  and  my intuition  is  more  open.  So  my  mind  will say  this  is  the  only  thing  this  is  the only  thing.  This  is  the  right  thing. This  is  the  wrong  thing.  Because  my intuition  will  never  say  that.  It  would just  say  I  feel  this  is  the  direction you  should  go  in.  But  it's  not  directive in  this  dedactic  way.  And  so  there's there's  freedom,  there's  choice,  there's that.  And  then  you  just  sparked  that  by saying  the  third  where  my  mind  is fearbased.  It's  like,  oh,  if  you  don't do  this,  it's  going  to  be  like  this. Whereas  my  intuition  will  be  like,  this is  the  path  to  love.  This  is  the  path  to peace.  This  is  the  path  to  happiness. This  is  the  path  to  joy.  And  and  those three  things  have  just  really  helped  me know  what  I'm  what  voice  I'm  listening to  because  it's  very  rare  for  my intuition  to  motivate  me  through  fear  or be  loud  or  be  very  very  fatalistic in  in  any  way.  And  the  mind  wants  to  be all  of  those  things. >> That's  so  beautiful  what  you  just shared. Absolutely.  The  mind  is  fear-based  and bossy  and  mean  a  lot  of  the  time  that's like,  you  know,  and  intuition  is  never it's  gentle.  There's  peace.  There's  an arrival  of  that  knowing.  It's  kind >> It's  based  in  love.  I  love  how eloquently  you  just  explained  that.  I think  that's  such  a  helpful  tool  because",

It's  kind >> It's  based  in  love.  I  love  how eloquently  you  just  explained  that.  I think  that's  such  a  helpful  tool  because so  many  of  us  can  recognize  when  we're in  those  moments  of  having  this  very negative  thought  patterning.  And  it's  so important  to  pause  and  recognize  it  that that's  just  coming  from  a  place  of  fear and  that's  not  divine.  It's  not  sacred within  your  own  being. >> That's  beautiful  how  you  just  explain. >> No,  it  took  it  took  me  a  while  to  I  was I  was  really  trying  to  decipher  because >> it  gets  messy.  We  get  so  many  signals. >> It  does.  Life  is  so  messy.  The  the cacophony  of  noise  and  energy  coming  at us  every  day  is  so  overwhelming.  It's hard  to  go  back  into  our  intuitive selves  and  listen  to  that  quieter, softer,  gentler  voice,  but  it's  so important. >> Yeah,  it's  so  important.  And  and  yeah,  I I  had  to  do  it  because  Yeah,  it's  so loud,  it's  so  noisy,  there's  so  many signals and  you  can  kind  of  get  quite overwhelmed  with  the  amount  you  have  to process. >> And  so  I  love  coming  up  with  systems. It's  almost  like  using  the  logical  brain to  help >> to  crack  the  code  of  how  to  access  the divine  connection  within.  Can  I  ask  you, have  you  found  that  there  are  certain places  where  you  almost  automatically default  into  a  state  of  connection  with your  team  of  light  where  you're  open more  to  the  messages  or  the  intuition that  comes  in? >> Yeah,  we  we  have  a  uh  meditation  room here  at  the  house  and  so  I  have  a  space for  that. >> That's  beautiful.  And  so  that  I'm  very lucky  to  have  that.  But  I've  always  had one  in  every  home  I've  grown  up  in.  It's it's  in  our  tradition  that  you  always have  that  space.  And  so  I've  always  had that.  Uh  even  when  we  had  an  apartment, it  was  a  a  small  corner  of  of  the apartment  where  we  had  that.  And  so that's  that's  definitely  a  place  I  feel it  when  I'm  in  India  for  sure.  When  I'm back  at  the  ashram  in  the  monastery  that I  lived  at. >> Uh  I  feel  it  around  certain  people.  I don't  think  it's  always  just  places. There's  people  as  well. >> Beautiful. >> Feel  it  here  for  sure  at  home.  Uh  I've tried  to  make  it  feel  that  way  wherever I  am >> and  I  find  that  to  be  a  a  place  within that  I  have  to  go  to  so  that  the  place",

I  think  purpose  is  a  big  part  of  that that someone  once  said  to  me,  they  said, \"Jay,  you  look  so  comfortable  in  all these  places  you  go  to  that  I  think  most people  are  uncomfortable  in.\"  And  I said,  \"It's  because  I  only  go  to  places I  have  a  purpose.

I'm  only uncomfortable  in  places  where  I  don't know  why  I'm  there.\" >> Wow. >> And  so,  that  really  helps  in  being clear,  I  feel.  I  think  I  want  to  talk  to you  about  that  clarity  that  we  want  to encourage  people  to  have  because  I  think it  starts  with  simpler  things  with  am  I clear  about  how  I  spend  my  time?  Am  I clear  about  why  I  am  where  I  am?  Am  I clear  about  why  I'm  having  lunch  or dinner  with  this  person?  Am  I  clear about  why  I'm  in  this  group  of  people? And  I  find  that  if  people  paused  to think  about  those  things,  they'd  realize they  weren't  clear  and  therefore  they didn't  enjoy  that  person's  company  or they  didn't  want  to  be  around  that  group of  people  and  they  come  back  feeling  not great  about  themselves  and  it  all  comes from  a  place  of  well  why  were  you  there? >> Yes. >> Does  that  make  sense? >> 100%.  I  think  so  often  we  are  just  on autopilot.  We're  going  through  the motions.  We're  following  whatever  our monkey  mind  tells  us.  We're  following the  logic  and  the  materialistic  paradigm that's  in  front  of  us.  and  we  forget about  this  beautiful  light  of  intention we  have  and  we  forget  to  focus  on  that and  so  we're  missing  half  the  beauty  and we're  also  kind  of  going  in  the  wrong direction  at  times  I  think  getting  back into  that  relationship  with  ourselves our  inner  selves  where  we  say  to ourselves  what  is  the  intention  behind this  what  is  the  meaning  for  me  and sometimes  we  might  be  guided  into  a situation  and  We  might  say  to  ourselves, why  am  I  here?  What  is  the  meaning  for me  in  this  moment?  And  if  we  just  get quiet,  we  can  reconnect  and  we  will  get",

What  is  the  meaning  for me  in  this  moment?  And  if  we  just  get quiet,  we  can  reconnect  and  we  will  get a  download  and  we  will  be  shown  the  why. You  know,  I  find  too  I  I  love  how  you shared  the  practices  you  do  to  get  in  a state  of  connection.  Although  J,  I  feel like  you're  always  in  a  state  of connection.  That's  what  I  see  on  your beautiful  energy.  Maybe  you  um  and  that you  help  other  people  get  into  a  state of  connection.  But  you  know,  so  many people  have  told  me  that  their  states  of connection  almost  happen  accidentally  in their  daily  lives.  Often  times  when  they take  showers,  I  think  it's  because  our our  monkey  mind  is  so  distracted  on shampooing  our  hair,  doing  this  that it's  on  this  kind  of  autopilot  of physicality  that  we  get  these  downloads and  connections  from  the  other  side.  So I've  heard  so  many  entrepreneurs  say,  \"I got  this  idea  in  the  shower.\"  Or  people will  say  like,  \"I  don't  know,  let  me sleep  on  it.\"  So  the  sleep  states another  time  we're  in  that  state  of  like connection  with  our  intuitive  self  and knowing  driving  believe  it  or  not  we'll get  these  downloads  sometimes  doing  like menial  tasks  like  cleaning  up  or something  like  that  we'll  be  in  a  state of  connection  and  I  think  what  I  find  so beautiful  about  that  is  our  teams  of light  are  always  looking  for  moments that  they  can  jump  right  in  show  us their  presence  help  us  understand  our journey  more  guide  us  on  our  path  more it's  just  even  better  if  you  create  the space  in  the  way  that  you  have  where maybe  you  have  a  a  little  sacred  space or  you  open  to  the  practice  of meditation  which  can  it's  so  beautiful right  so  when  we  pray  we're  directing our  thoughts  for  the  to  the  other  side and  they're  always  heard  but  when  we meditate  we're  listening  back  we're listening  for  the  guidance  and  so  what  a wonderful  practice  to  create  that  in  our own  lives >> wow  I  mean  I  love  how  you  just  gave  us so  many  simple  moments  in  the  day  that we  all  have  to  do  anyway that  can  all  be  these  moments  of >> connection  and  downloading  because  we often  look  at  these  things  as  so redundant  or  kind  of  a  bit  like  ah  just things  we  have  to  do  and  and  I  couldn't agree  with  you  more  on  the  driving  one.",
  "own  lives >> wow  I  mean  I  love  how  you  just  gave  us so  many  simple  moments  in  the  day  that we  all  have  to  do  anyway that  can  all  be  these  moments  of >> connection  and  downloading  because  we often  look  at  these  things  as  so redundant  or  kind  of  a  bit  like  ah  just things  we  have  to  do  and  and  I  couldn't agree  with  you  more  on  the  driving  one. I  always  say  to  people,  people  always say  to  me,  \"What  what  music  do  you listen  to  in  the  car?\"  And  I  said, \"When I'm  on  my  own,  I  don't  listen  to anything  because  I  feel  like  that's  like the  most  open  channel  I  have.\"  And  so  I always  drive  in  silence.  Even  on  really, unless  it's  late  at  night  and  I  have  to stay  awake,  then  I  have  a  late  night drive  playlist  cuz  then  I'm  like, \"Oh,  I don't  want  to  go  to  sleep.\"  But  but  if I'm  driving  and  my  energy  is  good,  I will  drive  in  silence  because  I  find  I  I don't  know  what  it  is  about  that  where you're  so  right  where  the  monkey  mind  is off.  You're  you're  on  a  monotonous highway  and  there's  you're  still obviously  attentive  to  the  road  and  I'm not  closing  my  eyes,  but  there's  a feeling  of  thoughts  coming  and  ideas coming  that  I  wouldn't  unlock  anywhere else. >> I  love  that  and  I  love  what  you're saying  about  being  in  a  state  of silence.  I  think  so  many  of  us  get trained  from  a  young  age  to  be  in  the state  of  noise  and  go  go  and  not  have that  silence.  So  how  beautiful  when  we welcome  the  silence  and  we  open  to  it because  that's  where  the  guidance  will really  show  up. >> How  do  we  do  that  when  we've  become  what you  just  said  it's  become  so uncomfortable  for  people  and  it  is  hard like  I  empathize  with  people  who  have been  overexposed  to  noise sound  music.  It  makes  you  feel comfortable.  It  makes  you  feel  safe  but you're  not  really  getting  anywhere right?  Like  it's  you  listen  to  your favorite  playlist.  It  makes  you  feel great  and  and  it  does,  but  it  doesn't really  make  you  feel  great.  Like  it's not >> Does  that  make  sense?  There's  a difference  between  like  There's  a difference  between  feeling  good  and  then a  good  feeling. >> Yes.  I  think  music  can  shift  your  energy and  like  change  your  vibration  and  bring all  this  light  in  and  change  your  mood. But  I  think  what  you're  talking  about  is it  maybe  doesn't  connect  us  super  fully with  our  own  inner  voice,  inner guidance,  team  of  light  downloads.  And so  one  of  my  favorite  recommendations  to people  if  you  really  want  to  try  to create  space  to  listen  back  is  to  go  on a  walk.  Don't  put  your  ear  buds  in.  Just",
  "But  I  think  what  you're  talking  about  is it  maybe  doesn't  connect  us  super  fully with  our  own  inner  voice,  inner guidance,  team  of  light  downloads.

Just go  for  a  walk.  It's  actually  called  a walking  meditation.  When  you  go  for  a walk  in  nature,  right?  And  you're  going to  be  fascinated  because  what  you  end  up doing  is  when  you're  in  a  state  of silence  on  this  walk,  you  start  first  to notice  the  small  details  of  beauty around  you.  You  know,  these  glimpses  of God  energy  that's  been  put  in  your  path. You  might  notice  the  beautiful  sky that's  also  been  put  right  in  your  path for  our  connection.  And  then  you  might also  notice  that  you  start  getting information  in  a  way  that's  other  than your  normal  senses.  I  always  talk  about the  psychic  toolbox  we  all  have  and  I think  understanding  what  these  kind  of what  I  call  the  floor  clares  are  might help  people  access  that  part  of themselves  and  the  other  thing  is  I think  many  of  us  are  doing  this automatically  anyway  we  might  just  not have  a  word  for  it  so  you  know  the  first one's  clairvoyance  and  it  means  clear seeing  and  it's  this  concept  of  you  know when  we  sleep  at  night  and  our  physical eyes  are  closed  but  we're  vividly  seeing things  in  our  dreams  that's  our  psychic vision  it's  what  a  lot  of  cultures  have called  the  third  high,  but  we  always have  that  available  to  us  at  all  times. And  so,  learn  to  trust  it  in  your  waking hours,  too.  Like  for  me,  I  always  kind of  see  people  in  colors.  It's  a  form  of synthesia,  blending  of  senses.  That  can happen  for  anyone.  You  might  learn  that there's  a  whole  kind  of  clairvoyant energy  that's  accessible  to  you  to perceive  in  different  ways.  Or  you  might meet  somebody  and  get  little  glimpses  on your  inner,  you  know,  mind's  eye  screen. Trust  all  that.  There's  also  clair audience,  which  means  clear  hearing.  And it's  when  we  hear  a  thought  that  comes to  us,  not  from  us.  And  this  is  a beautiful  way  that  our  teams  of  light, our  loved  ones  on  the  other  side,  our spirit  guides,  God  energy  can  connect with  us  and  guide  us  in  a  very  direct way.  But  you  know  what  I  find  happens when  people  have  these  moments  of thoughts  arriving  to  them.  They  tend  to dismiss  it.  They're  like,  \"Where  did that  come  from?\"  And  just  ignore  it.  Pay attention  to  that.  Then  there's  clear cognizance  which  I've  mentioned  which  is clear  knowing  and  is  this  all  of  a sudden  download  of  information  where  you",
  "with  us  and  guide  us  in  a  very  direct way.  But  you  know  what  I  find  happens when  people  have  these  moments  of thoughts  arriving  to  them.  They  tend  to dismiss  it.  They're  like,  \"Where  did that  come  from?\"  And  just  ignore  it.  Pay attention  to  that.  Then  there's  clear cognizance  which  I've  mentioned  which  is clear  knowing  and  is  this  all  of  a sudden  download  of  information  where  you just  know  something  in  every  ounce  of your  being.  And  do  you  know  how  you  can tell  if  you're  really  really  sharp  and open  clar  cognizantly  if  your  friends and  maybe  family  members  throughout  your life  have  said  to  you,  you  know,  you give  really  good  advice  because  what you're  actually  doing  is  you're  tuning in  to  get  information  for  them  in  a clare  cognizant  way.  And  then  there's clair  sentience  which  means  clear feeling.  It's  this  idea  of  feeling  all the  unseen  energy  around  us.  So  an example  of  that  is  meeting  somebody  for the  first  time  and  not  just  getting  a  3D impression  of  them  but  an  energetic  one as  well. >> And  people  are  super  open  or  who  are empaths  will  also  experience  the  emotion those  people  are  experiencing.  Right? But  that  is  an  inner  guidance  too.  We're being  guided  with  that  because  sometimes we  might  feel  very  neutral  to  the person.  No  harm,  no  foul.  Sometimes  we might  even  have  a  little  bit  of  an allergic  reaction,  right?  It's  not really  about  judgment,  but  it's,  you know,  you're  being  guided  away  from  that person  for  a  reason.  Maybe  they're  not on  your  highest  path  to  know.  And  then every  now  and  then,  we'll  just  get  this really  magnetic  pull  to  a  person  where we  we  feel  like  we  know  them,  but  we've just  met  them,  but  we  know  we're  meant to  know  them.  We  want  to  talk  to  them. We  know  we  have  a  shared  journey  in  some way.  And  I  think  trusting that  inner  guidance  and  creating  space for  that  in  our  lives  in  whatever  way  we can,  whether  it's  going  for  a  walk  alone or  if  it's  just  being  open  like  next time  you  take  a  shower,  say  to  your  team like,  \"Okay,  I'm  all  in.  Give  me  the guidance.\"  Just  paying  attention  to those  tools  we  all  have  within  us  to communicate,  to  get  the  information  in new  ways  can  transform  our  lives.  One  of the  things  I  love  too  when  people  really tune  in  and  trust  the  guidance  is  how  it transforms  the  stories  that  they've often  told  themselves  about  everything they've  already  experienced  in  their past.  You  know,  a  lot  of  times  what  our monkey  minds  might  assess  as  a  failure in  our  life  actually  isn't.  It  was  a beautiful  journey  of  understanding  or  we did  something  extraordinary  for  someone else  that  we're  not  recognizing.  And",
  "often  told  themselves  about  everything they've  already  experienced  in  their past.  You  know,  a  lot  of  times  what  our monkey  minds  might  assess  as  a  failure in  our  life  actually  isn't.  It  was  a beautiful  journey  of  understanding  or  we did  something  extraordinary  for  someone when  we  really  tune  into  that  guidance, we  begin  to  unfold  a  new  story  within ourselves  and  it  can  just  make  our  past so  much  more  beautiful  and  our  future  so much  more  beautiful  and  our  present  so much  more  beautiful. >> Well,  I  think  that's  the  challenge.  One thing  that  you  just  touched  on  there  is that  we  evaluate  the  success  of something  based  on  the  result. >> Yeah. >> Not  on  the  intention,  not  on  the intuition,  not  on  the  input.  And  that  is misleading  because  you  could  do something  with  the  most  beautiful intention  and  energy  and  intuitive knowing  and  it  may  not  work  out externally. Right?  I  think  sometimes  people  say, \"Well,  if  this  is  the  right  person  for me,  send  me  a  sign.\" But  because  you  weren't  clear  in  your question, right  person  for  what, >> right?  They  could  be  the  right  person for  right  now  to  teach  you  a  lesson  or for  you  to  learn  something.  But  but  the problem  is  when  you  say  the  words  right person,  you  mean  the  person  I'm  going  to spend  the  rest  of  my  life  with. >> And  so  talk  to  me  about  how  clear  we have  to  be  as  we  communicate.  Because  I think  I've  heard  a  lot  of  people  get  the exact  sign  they  want,  but  then  that doesn't  end  up  being  the  exact  person they  want.  Yeah,  I  love  this  question because  I  think  what  we're  really  doing is  we're  experiencing  life  in  a  very limited  way  when  we  ask  questions  like that.  Here's  the  truth.  The  universe always  dreams  bigger  for  us  than  we  can. And  there  is  a  connectivity  that  spans over  time  and  a  much  bigger  picture  than we  can  often  see  in  our  little  myopic view  of  the  here  and  now  or  where  we're at  in  our  lives  or  the  experience  we're having.  So  the  question  I  would  love people  to  ask  instead  of  is  this  the right  person?  Is  this  the  right  job  is to  change  how  we're  asking  the  question and  here  is  how  it  could  be  asked.  Is this  person  my  highest  experience  to have  in  this  moment?

  "having.  So  the  question  I  would  love people  to  ask  instead  of  is  this  the right  person?  Is  this  the  right  job  is to  change  how  we're  asking  the  question and  here  is  how  it  could  be  asked.  Is this  person  my  highest  experience  to have  in  this  moment?  Am  I  on  my  highest path  right  now  by  having  this  journey with  this  person?  Am  I  in  my  highest path  right  now  by  being  in  the  career I'm  in?  If  so,  send  me  a  sign.  So,  the signs  aren't  the  answers.  They're  the reassurance  of  our  own  inner  guidance. It's  that  reassuring  knowing  that  we have  that  we  are  beloved.  We  are  guided. And  even  if  we  can't  understand  the experience  we're  having,  there  is something  divine  in  it.  It's  trusting  in our  team  of  light.  It's  trusting  in  our purpose  even  when  we  can't  see  it.  And this  is  the  hard  part.  It's  surrendering to  the  experience.  We  all  want  the answers  right  away.  There  have  been times  that  I'll  get  downloads  in  my  life from  my  team  of  light  and  they  will  say to  me,  \"This  is  all  we're  telling  you right  now.  You  are  not  allowed  to  know anything  else.\"  And  I  call  it  being blocked  because  I  can  see.  It's  as  if there's  a  door  in  front  of  me.  They won't  let  me  see.  And  in  those  moments, I  know  something  divine  is  going  on. It's  that  I'm  meant  to  experience  either a  moment  of  patience  or  a  moment  of trust  or  there's  a  bigger  picture  going on  that  I'm  not  meant  to  know  the answers  for.  And  it's  in  those  moments where  I  have  learned  to  surrender.  And the  moment  I  surrender  to  that,  magical things  unfold  or  within  time  I'm  shown how  that  mattered  or  why  I  was  in  that situation  or  why  that  didn't  unfold  in the  timing  maybe  I  wanted  it  to.  But this  truth  isn't  just  a  truth  for  me. It's  a  truth  for  us  all.  No  one  is forgotten  by  the  universe.  No  experience is  accidental.  No  relationship  is accidental.  There  is  a  divine  cord  of light  and  meaning  and  connectivity  in all  things.  Each  and  every  one  of  us  are part  of  each  other's  journeys  in  ways that  we  can't  really  see  or  fully understand  when  we're  here.  But  trusting in  it,  trusting  in  that  guidance  and asking  for  the  guidance  to  be  shown  that I'm  on  my  path.  I'm  having  the experiences  I've  meant  to  right  now  and",

I'm  having  the experiences  I've  meant  to  right  now  and I  am  not  alone.  That's  the  question  we should  be  asking  to  be  reassured  of  in beautiful  ways. >> I'll  just  give  you  an  example  from  my own  life. >> My  youngest  daughter  is  applying  to colleges  this  coming  year.  She's  a >> congratulations. >> Yeah,  it's  really  an  exciting  time  and we  toured  all  these  colleges  and  we  went to  one  particular  college  that  I  loved and  I  was  like  if  I  were  going  to  choose college  again,  this  was  the  one  I  was going  to  choose.  And  in  that  exact moment  of  feeling  like  the  state  of  like connection  and  being  guided  even  in where  we  were  going,  I  glanced  across the  street  and  randomly  out  of  the  blue was  one  single  orange  like  the  fruit  an orange  which  long  ago  I  established  with my  team  of  light  to  mean  you're completely  on  path.  We're  here  with  you. You're  on  your  highest  path.  And  I  saw it  and  I  got  a  download  from  my  guides too  and  they  said  to  me  this  is  an example  you  can  share  because  we're  not telling  you  this  is  the  college.  We're telling  you  that  the  college  she  is meant  to  go  to  is  being  divinely orchestrated.  She  is  being  divinely guided  and  just  trust  the  process.  Don't force  anything.  Just  experience.  And  it was  such  a  beautiful  moment  for  me because  it  took  all  that  pressure  off  of like,  let  me  analyze  everything  that's going  on,  the  energy  I'm  feeling,  what  I think  is  the  best  match  for  her,  then how  to  make  things  happen.  No,  it  was  a reminder  to  me  how  guided  we  all  are, but  how  loved  and  supported  we  all  are on  the  journey. >> And  surrendering  to  that  guidance,  I think,  makes  our  journeys  so  much  more peaceful.  It  brings  an  ease.  It  brings  a light.  It  brings  a  magic  to  it.  And  it makes  us  realize  we're  not  the  only  ones who  create  things  and  drive  things. There's  a  force  so  much  greater  than ourselves  that's  watching  over  that's bringing  us  to  these  experiences  and  to the  people  we're  meant  to  know  and  to the  knowledge  we're  meant  to  gain  in such  a  profound  and  beautiful  way. >> I  I  love  what  you're  saying.

I  love what  you're  saying  because  it  it  helps so  much  with  this life  in  which  control  has  become  our primary  mechanism  of  growth.  And  I've always  seen  it  as  this  beautiful  balance between  endeavor  and  surrender. >> Yes.  That >> which  is  this  beautiful  dance  and  play. >> Yes.  But  when  endeavor  becomes  control and  surrender  doesn't  exist, it  becomes  really  hard  actually  because you  want  everything  to  work  out  exactly how  you  planned  it.  And  if  it  doesn't happen  exactly  how  you  planned  it, >> then  it's  not  good.  It  won't  be  good.  It couldn't  be.  And  I  think,  well,  wait  a minute.  What  if  it  was  better?  What  if you  learn  something  that  becomes  useful for  the  future?  What  if  it  being  pushed back  and  further  than  you  thought actually  ended  up  making  it  the  perfect timing?  And  and  it's  how  do  we  open ourselves  up  to  those  ideas?  I  love  what you're  saying.  How  do  you  actually because  we've  been  so  conditioned  in  a world  of  control  where  if  it  doesn't happen  like  this,  then  it's  not  going  to happen  and  it's  not  right.  Because >> I  I  was  just  thinking  about  the  other day.  I  was  thinking  about  this  really this  morning.

And >> people  would  have  said  to  him,  \"Oh, you're  getting  married  so  late  and  now you  have  kids  so  late  and  whatever.\"  And it's  like,  but  it  doesn't  work  like that.  But  we  live  in  this  life  that's very  rigid.  Yeah. >> How  do  we  break  that?  How  do  we >> how  do  we  move  through  that?  Because  how do  we  rise  to  peace  and  surrender  and when  when  we  live  in  a  world  that's  all about  control  and >> planning?  How  do  we  have  a  spiritual experience  when  we're  living  in  such  a materialistic  paradigm  of  belief? >> Yeah.

  ">> how  do  we  move  through  that?  Because  how do  we  rise  to  peace  and  surrender  and when  when  we  live  in  a  world  that's  all about  control  and >> planning?  How  do  we  have  a  spiritual experience  when  we're  living  in  such  a materialistic  paradigm  of  belief? >> Yeah.  I  think  the  most  important  thing we  can  do  is  recognize  that  our  inner narrative  when  it's  mean,  when  it's bossy, when  it's  controlling,  when  it's  telling us  a  story  of  what  needs  to  happen  in order  to  either  be  like  the  rest  of  the people  or  gain  some  control  over  our  own lives  or  especially  if  we  get  this  kind of  panicky  feeling  about  how  things  are going  or  did  we  miss  like  that  that  idea of  like  FOMO,  fear  of  missing  out  right when  we  get  that  sense  of  oh  my  goodness I  need  to  be  there  or  I  need  to  have done  done  that  already  or  that  needed  to happen  yesterday  or  am  I  off  path  is  to recognize  that  that's  not  your  spiritual self >> to  recognize  that  there's  a  divine guidance  for  each  and  every  person  and what  is  meant  to  be  for  one  person  in one  timeline  is  the  exact  opposite  of what  might  be  for  you  in  your  timeline. It's  to  get  into  that  state  of  surrender to  understanding  that  we  are  so  loved and  we  are  so  guided  and  that  if  we trust  in  it  the  feeling  we  will  get  will be  one  of  peace, >> of  love,  of  gentleness.  But  I  think actually  what  you're  describing  is  part of  our  soul  journey  here.  It's  part  of the  ways  that  our  souls  are  tested  all the  time,  every  day.  And  a  lot  of  what you  just  described  too  has  to  do  with comparison.  You  know,  the  other  side taught  me  long  ago  that  the  only  person we  are  ever  competing  with  is  oursel. It's  how  we're  growing.  But  yet  daily we're  going  to  be  invited by  this  materialistic  paradigm  of  of belief  here  to  be  in  competition  with one  another,  to  have  power  over  each other,  to  get  there  first,  to  do  this this  this  mentality  of  almost,  you  know, dirt  mentality.  there's  not  enough  of any  one  thing,  you  know,  or  everything has  to  fit  this  mold  and  if  you  don't  do that,  you're  going  to  miss  out.  That's not  truth  at  all.  That's  not  how  God energy  works.  That's  not  how  guidance works.  That's  not  why  our  souls  are here. >> And  so,  it's  so  easy  to  get  caught  up  in that  stream  of  panic  and  anxiety  and control  and  false  forms  of  power,  right? I  think  it's  so  powerful  when  we  pause.",
  "has  to  fit  this  mold  and  if  you  don't  do that,  you're  going  to  miss  out.  That's not  truth  at  all.  That's  not  how  God energy  works.  That's  not  how  guidance works.

We  take  this  sacred  pause  to  recognize when  we're  feeling  that  way  and  where it's  coming  from.  And  there's  this moment  we  have  within  ourselves  where  we get  to  reject  that  where  we  say,  you know  what,  I  can't  stop  these  negative thoughts.  That  monkey  mind  is  chattering and  I  hear  it  loudly  and  clearly,  but  I reject  that.  You  know  what?  No,  my  life is  unfolding  exactly  as  it's  meant  to. And  I  am  so  excited  and  I  am  so  full  of gratitude  to  be  here  and  experience  all the  things  I'm  meant  to  experience  in divine  timing.  And  I  surrender  to  that. >> It's  a  practice. >> Yeah,  it's  a  practice. >> It's  a  practice. >> And  and  it's  a  both.  It's  a  it's  a  this and  I  always  try  to  remind  people  that  I think  we  constantly  just  oscillate between  extremes  of  okay,  nothing's  in my  control.  Okay.  Everything's  in  my control.  So,  so  we  go  from  everything was  in  my  control.  Now  I've  read  guided and  now  nothing's  in  my  It's  like,  well, that's  not  what  you're  saying.  That's not  what  I'm  saying. >> Yeah. >> And  I  think  that's  the  common misconception  where, >> oh,  I  used  to  be  in  charge  of everything.  Now  I  just  let  the  universe do  what  it  wants.  And  it's  like,  well, the  universe  is  only  reciprocating  with you  and  interacting  with  you.  So,  it can't  do  something  that  you're  not opening  yourself  up  to.  So,  it's endeavor  and  surrender  together. >> Yeah.  that  it's  this  co-creation together.  And  it's  also  showing  up  as the  best  version  of  ourselves, challenging  only  ourselves  and  our  sense of  ourselves  to  be  kinder,  more  loving, to  look  at  the  world  with  gratitude,  to look  at  our  own  lives  and  what's happened  to  us  with  the  lens  of  love,  of looking  what  love  have  I  gained,  not what  negativity  or  what  experiences  made me  feel  less  than,  but  who  has  loved  me? How  have  I  found  love?  What  can  I  be grateful  for  in  this  moment?  Because when  we  get  in  that  mindset,  the spiritual  self  gets  louder  and  the  trust gets  louder  and  we  learn  to  show  up  for ourselves  in  these  really  powerful  and beautiful  ways.

  "me  feel  less  than,  but  who  has  loved  me? How  have  I  found  love?  What  can  I  be grateful  for  in  this  moment?  Because when  we  get  in  that  mindset,  the spiritual  self  gets  louder  and  the  trust gets  louder  and  we  learn  to  show  up  for ourselves  in  these  really  powerful  and beautiful  ways.  Being  guided  and  leading a  guided  life,  it  doesn't  mean  like sitting  back  and  just  giving  up  on everything  and  not  it  means  we  hold ourselves  accountable  by  doing  this.  We search  ourselves  to  find  what  gifts  we came  here  programmed  with  because  every single  person  comes  programmed  with unique  gifts.  And  then  we  honor  them.  We hold  sacred  space  within  ourselves  for them  and  we  share  them  with  others.  And then  we  come  to  our  connection  with others  with  the  understanding  that  true power  is  not  wielding  gifts  or  you  know things  over  one  another  and  being  like look  what  I  have  or  learn  from  me  or  do this.  It's  an  understanding that  we  all  rise  together  and  by  showing up  with  the  best  version  of  who  we  are, by  honoring  our  gifts  and  like  coming with  a  gracious  heart  and  coming  in trust  and  love  and  gratitude  and  using forgiveness  as  a  tool,  right?  We're automatically  elevating  everybody  else's experience  as  well.  What  I've  learned when  I've  dived  into  like  kind  of  the quantum  physics  of  all  this  is  that thoughts  matter  more  than  we  realize. Thoughts  are  energy.  You  know,  energy and  matter  are  interchangeable.  Einstein proved  that,  right?  And  thoughts,  the way  I'm  shown,  they're  light  energy.  Our souls  are  light  energy.  And  so,  every thought  we  have  is  either  putting  more light  into  the  world  or  putting  more darkness  in. >> And  it's  an  absolute  truth.  And  so  when we  have  these  moments  where  we  are  being so  mean  to  ourselves  in  our  little monkey  minds  and  blah  blah  telling ourselves  a  very  mean  story  about  an experience  that  we're  having  or  how  lost we  are  on  path  or  how  nothing  has  worked in  our  favor  or  I  tried  this  in  it's  so important  to  pause  for  that  moment  and tell  ourselves  a  new  story  that  no  no no no  I'm  having  this  spiritual  experience and  trusting  that  in  some  way  it's connected  to  a  collective  lesson  in  love for  us  all  and  that  we  are  more connected  and  part  of  each  other's journeys  than  we  can  fathom  and welcoming  that  trust  of  that  knowing  in >> because  it  will  make  a  difference.

  "no  I'm  having  this  spiritual  experience and  trusting  that  in  some  way  it's connected  to  a  collective  lesson  in  love for  us  all  and  that  we  are  more connected  and  part  of  each  other's journeys  than  we  can  fathom  and welcoming  that  trust  of  that  knowing  in >> because  it  will  make  a  difference.  We get  into  a  very  different  state  of  being when  we  learn  to  trust  in  our  own  light and  in  our  connection  to  one  another  and our  teams  of  light  on  the  other  side. >> Laura,  I  wanted  to  ask  you,  what  do people  come  to  you  with  the  most  often? What's  the  most  common  thing  you  get asked  when  people  come  to  see  you? >> It's  interesting  because  when  I  do readings,  I  tell  people,  \"Save  all  your questions.  save  them  all  till  the  end because  the  other  side  always  has  a  plan and  guides  every  session  I  do.  I  I'm  not the  mind  of  God.  I  can  only  share  what  a a  sitter,  the  person  I'm  reading  for, team  of  light  shares  with  me.  But  I  can tell  you  the  most  common  things  that they  share. Often  times  if  people  come  in  grief,  I find  what  the  other  side  wants  to reassure  them  of  is  just  how  present their  loved  ones  are.  And  so  their  loved ones  will  come  through  and  they'll  start sharing  all  the  ways  they've  already been  connecting  with  them.  Whether  it's through  a  dream  visitation,  whether  it was  through  showing  them  a  beautiful sky,  sometimes  even  sending  messages  in clouds,  um  sending  rainbows,  sending hearts,  messing  with  the  electricity,  um putting  coins  in  their  path,  or  sending creatures  who  navigate  our  world  using electromagnetic  fields  such  as  birds, butterflies,  dragonflies,  deer,  fox,  you name  it. They  like  to  show  them  how  they've already  shown  up  in  their  lives. The  message  they  always  share  is  our relationship,  our  love  hasn't  gone anywhere.  If  anything,  it's  gotten stronger.  They  love  being  able  to  be present  at  all  times  and  in  all  places with  their  loved  ones.  Right?  So  a  lot of  times  a  person's  grief  journey  will be  addressed  but  the  reassurance  that's there  is  that  the  connection  with  their loved  ones  is  inherent.  These  cords  of love  and  connection  cannot  be  broken. And  the  message  is  there  too  that  they don't  need  a  session  with  me  to  ever access  that.  So  a  lot  of  times  they're showing  how  present  they've  already  been",

So  a  lot  of  times  they're showing  how  present  they've  already  been before  we've  ever  had  a  session.  I  think that  that's  very  common.  So would  would  you  have  the  download  that they  share  something  like where  you  ask  the  person  sitting  in front  of  you have  you  seen  a you  know  bluebird  or  whatever  it  may  be or  have  you  seen  a  butterfly  and  they would  say  yeah  I  noticed  it  in  these moments  and  then  that's  what  you're hearing  is  the >> yeah  so  I  would  be  having  a  conversation with  let's  say  somebody's  father's  on the  other  side  and  he  might  be  showing me  that  he's  sent  cardinals and  telling  me  that  he  sent  these cardinals,  but  let's  say  his  daughter got  it  and  was  like,  \"hm,  is  that  a sign?\"  And  so  then  he  sent  double rainbows  and  she  got  that  and  she  said, \"hm,  is  that  a  sign?\"  So  I'll  say  this, \"Your  father's  telling  me  he  sent cardinals  and  rainbows  and  that  you received  them  and  he  wants  you  to  trust that  it's  him.\"  And  that's  usually  where the  person  will  have  this  moment  of recognizing  that  they  did  push  back  on it,  that  they  had  known  that  deep  down that  that  was  a  form  of  communication. They  just  hadn't  trusted  it  yet. >> So  I  think  sometimes  I'm  just  a facilitator  in  validating  what  the person  already  knows  or  I'm,  you  know,  I look  at  myself  as  a  teacher  here  more than  a  psychic  medium.  happen  to  be  a psychic  medium,  but  my  real  goal  is  to teach  people  that  nobody  ever  needs  me. We  all  have  this  connection  to  those that  we  love  who's  crossed  to  to  the  God energy  to  our  guides  to  that  trust  and knowing  and  that  guidance  and  that feeling  of  being  loved  and  connected  to anybody  who  we  may  have  lost  in  the physical.  Right?  I  meant  to  teach  them how  to  access  that  within  themselves. And  here's  the  thing,  the  doorway  is there.  All  we  need  to  do,  the  one component  we  each  need  to  bring  is  to trust  it.  But  that's  harder  than  it sounds,  right?  Because  again,  we're getting  all  this  messaging  and  we  have from  a  very  young  age  to  not  trust  it,",
  "physical.  Right?  I  meant  to  teach  them how  to  access  that  within  themselves. And  here's  the  thing,  the  doorway  is there.

Because  again,  we're getting  all  this  messaging  and  we  have from  a  very  young  age  to  not  trust  it, to  only  trust  what  we  can  see  and  touch and  only  come  up  with  logical  plans  and that  there's  not  enough  for  everybody and  you  have  to  stick  to  like  the  status quo  and  all  of  these  things.  So,  it's very  counterintuitive  to  make  that  shift within.  I  will  also  say  that  oftentimes I  find  a  topic  that's  brought  up  by people's  teams  of  light  on  the  other side  is  where  they  might  be  in  their particular  career  or  relationship  at  the moment.  And  it's  so  interesting  because the  message  is  always  you're  right  where you're  meant  to  be  right  now.  It's  more about  the  questions  or  the  exploration that  might  be  going  on.  And  it  might also  be  their  team  of  lights  saying,  \"We know  2  months  ago  you  started  feeling that  you  needed  to  make  a  shift  in  your career  and  logically  it  doesn't  make sense  cuz  you're  doing  great,  but they're  showing  me  that  you  had  this pull  to  do  this  artistic  endeavor  and they  want  you  to  trust  in  that.\"  And  the person  will  say  that  did  happen  exactly two  months  ago.  I  did  have  that,  but it's  I,  you  know,  I  felt  like  I  was getting  too  big  for  my  britches.  How dare  I  dream  that  you?  The  universe  is going  to  dream  bigger  for  you.  And  if you're  having  these  moments  of  feeling something  or  recognizing  something that's  coming  from  outside  of  yourself, trusting  in  it  makes  all  the  difference. This  is  the  thing.  Nobody  needs  a reading.  Nobody  ever  does.  We  just  need to  know  that  that  connection  is  there. And  we  need  to  have  a  belief  in ourselves,  in  our  own  ability  to  be guided,  to  find  our  highest  path  and trust  our  own  light  as  well.  Because  I think  sometimes  we  think  we're  not enough  or  we  think,  \"Oh,  I  should  just stay  smaller.  I  should  stay  this  smaller version  of  myself.\"  you  know,  I shouldn't  want  more  or  I  shouldn't  pay attention  to  this  pull  or  this  longing or  this  inspiration  I  got  as  a  download or  as  a  dream  or  this.  It's  paying attention  to  those  moments  within",
  "think  sometimes  we  think  we're  not enough  or  we  think,  \"Oh,  I  should  just stay  smaller.  I  should  stay  this  smaller version  of  myself.\"  you  know,  I shouldn't  want  more  or  I  shouldn't  pay attention  to  this  pull  or  this  longing or  this  inspiration  I  got  as  a  download or  as  a  dream  or  this.  It's  paying attention  to  those  moments  within ourselves  that  are  going  to  guide  us  the most  because  we  have  the  tools  within. >> Yeah.  And  it's  starting  somewhere  small with  those  little  things.  Like  last  time you  were  here,  I  was  talking  about  how >> every  time  I  think  of  someone,  I  text them.  And  so  it's  a  really  simple,  easy way,  but  every  time  I  think  of  someone, I  think,  well,  that's  not  random.  And why  don't  I  just  tell  them  I'm  thinking of  them?  I  don't  not  asking  for anything.  I'm  not  messaging  because  I have  I  don't  need  anything.  I'm  just saying,  \"Hey,  I  was  thinking  of  you sending  lots  of  love.\"  Or  whatever  it may  be. >> And  nine  times  out  of  10,  someone  will respond  and  say,  \"I  was  just  thinking about  you.  I  was  just  talking  about  you or  I  really  needed  that  right  now.\" >> Yes.  And  I  think  it's  doing  it  in  those really  small  ways  where  you're  taking  an action  based  on  the  knowing  rather  than just  looking  around  at  you  testing  the signs  because  I  think  that's  the  shift. I  think  if  you're  looking  around  you constantly  you're  always  looking  outside of  yourself.  To  me  there's  some  degree of  a  dependence  that  is  being  developed that  is  not  yet  selfrust.  It's  still saying  the  truth  is  outside  of  me. Whereas  when  you're  just  listening  to  a little  inkling  that  says,  \"Oh,  it's someone's  birthday  today.  Why  don't  you check  in  with  them?\"  Or,  \"Hey,  did  you you  just  thought  of  this  person?\"  Send them  a  message.  Call  them  up.  Hey,  why don't  you  know,  whatever  it  may  be.  Oh, you  saw  something  and  you  remembered something.  Buy  it  for  them  and  give  it to  them  whenever  you  see  them.  Like, it's  those  little  things  that  I  think start  to  get  you  to  trust  your  own knowing.  Whereas  if  it's  always,  well, show  me  this  universe,  show  me  this, show  me  this,  show  me  this,  I  don't  know what  you're  doing  then  to  to,  you  know, really  get  there,  if  that  makes  sense. >> So  Jay,  what  you  just  described  to  a  tea is  a  difference  between  opening  to  the language  of  signs  versus  living  a  guided life. >> It's  trusting  all  those  poles,  all  those chords  of  connection. >> And  you  know what?  Our  monkey  minds might  say  like,  \"Oh,  I'm  really  busy right  now.  I'm  not  going  to  stop  what I'm  doing  and  go  text  that  person.\"  But our  spiritual  self  is  saying,  \"No,  no, no,  no.  There's  this  web  of  light  and connectivity.  We're  all  part  of  each",
  "language  of  signs  versus  living  a  guided life. >> It's  trusting  all  those  poles,  all  those chords  of  connection. >> And  you  know what?

We're  all  part  of  each other's  journeys.  And  there's  this  like amazing connection  of  light  between  us  all.  If it's  like  an  invisible  fishing  line between  us  and  each  other  here  on  Earth and  us  and  our  loved  ones  on  the  other side,  you  tug  on  one  end,  the  other person  feels  it.  So,  the  greatest  way  we can  honor  living  a  guided  life  is  when we  get  those  moments  to  act  on  them.  And that's  what  we  were  talking  about before,  saying  living  a  guided  life isn't  just  surrendering  and  sitting back.  It's  learning  to  trust  and  then learning  to  have  those  thoughts, recognize  them,  and  take  action  because of  it.  Because  you  might  end  up  changing somebody's  entire  path  that  day  or helping  them  avoid  something  or  giving this  them  this  moment  of  feeling  so loved  and  connected  and  reminded  of  who they  are  in  a  spiritual  way. >> What  a  beautiful  thing  you  do.  Like  you said,  everyone  can  do  it.  Like  I  don't have  a  power.  That's  what  I'm  saying that  I  don't  have  I  know  last  time  you were  like  everyone  has  powers.  And  and what  I'm  trying  to  say  in  order  to  help everyone  who's  listening  is  like  I'm  not claiming  to  have  any  ability.  I'm  just listening.  And  so  anyone  can  do  that. Everyone  can  do  that. >> Everybody  has  that  power.  We  all  are psychic  mediums.  We  don't  have  to  call ourselves  that,  but  we  all  have  that state  of  connectivity. >> And  what  you're  sharing  is  so  beautiful. I  remember  seeing  a  story  on  the internet  that  was  posted  by  someone  and he  he  posted  a  picture  of  a  sunflower and  he  said,  \"I  want  to  share  the story.\"  He  said,  \"I  went  on  a  date  last night.  It  was  really  great.\"  So,  I bought  the  sunflower  that  I  was  going  to go  leave  on  her  car  and  then  I  had  this moment  of  going  like,  \"Ooh,  that's  a little  bit  too  intense.\"  He  said,  \"So,  I just  had  this  download  this  sense  that  I was  actually  meant  to  give  this sunflower  to  someone  else.\"  So,  he  said, \"So,  I  walked  around  and  I  just  felt like  that  I'm  meant  to  give  it  to  this woman.\"  So  he  walked  over  to  her  and  he said,  \"Listen,  I  know  this  might  sound  a little  weird.  I  bought  this  sunflower thinking  I  was  going  to  give  it  to somebody  else,  but  I'm  I'm  feeling  that it's  actually  meant  for  you.  So  I  want",

I  bought  this  sunflower thinking  I  was  going  to  give  it  to somebody  else,  but  I'm  I'm  feeling  that it's  actually  meant  for  you.  So  I  want to  give  it  to  you.  I  don't  want  to  just leave  it  to  die.  I  want  to  give  it  to you.\"  And  she  started  tearing  up  and  she said,  \"What  you  don't  know  is  that  this is  my  fiance's  birthday  and  he  crossed the  other  side  and  he  used  to  always  buy me  sunflowers.\"  Wow. >> And  he  said,  \"And  then  I  was  weeping  and she  was  weeping.\"  But  it's  an  exact example  of  being  guided.  We  all  have these  moments  because  being  guided,  it's not  just  about  our  own  journeys  and finding  our  own  highest  path  and  the best  relationship  or  the  best  career  or that.  It's  about  how  we  influence  and effect  each  other's  journeys,  how  we bring  love  and  kindness,  how  we  remind each  other  of  the  sacredness,  the  divine in  all  of  us. >> Yeah.  So,  exactly  what  you  shared,  it's doing  those  small  actions  that  we  feel pulled  to  do  for  whatever  reason. >> Yeah.  Well,  I  was  I  was  I  was  thinking about uh  this  example  earlier  where  I  know someone  who  was  telling  me  about  how their  son  has  a  particular  affinity  for Krishna  and  Krishna  in  my  tradition  is is  the  name  of  God.  And  they  were  saying that  their  son  likes  to  look  at  books  of Krishna  and  pictures  of  Krishna  and  they go  to  a  temple  where  they  can  see  these. But  then  once  when  they  went  to  this temple  the  there  was  no  book  and  their son  was  really  sad  that  the  book  had gone  and  it  had  been  misplaced. >> And  so  I  had  this  feeling  that  I  would give  this  gift.  Now  there's  lots  of books  of  Krishna  that  exist  in  our tradition  but  there's  this  one particular  one  that  I  I  love  and  have  an affinity  for.  And  I  said,  \"Okay,  well, next  time  I  see  them,  I'm  going  to  get this  book  for  them.\"  So,  I  went  to  see them  and  I  took  this  book  as  a  surprise and  it  was  wrapped  up.  And  when  they opened  the  wrapping,  this  person  like hug  the  book.  I  was  like, \"Wow,  that's  I mean,  that's  beautiful  reaction,  but it's  a  very  strong  emotion, >> right?\" >> And  it  was  really  interesting  because  I I  said,  \"Oh,  like  I  I  kind  of  I  probably didn't  even  say  it.  I  just  looked  like, wow,  that's  that's  pretty  that's  a",
  "them  and  I  took  this  book  as  a  surprise and  it  was  wrapped  up.  And  when  they opened  the  wrapping,  this  person  like hug  the  book.  I  was  like, \"Wow,  that's  I mean,  that's  beautiful  reaction,  but it's  a  very  strong  emotion, >> right?\" >> And  it  was  really  interesting  because  I I  said,  \"Oh,  like  I  I  kind  of  I  probably didn't  even  say  it.  I  just  looked  like, wow,  that's  that's  pretty  that's  a strong  emotion  to  hug  a  book.\" >> And  she  said,  \"Thank  you.\"  And  was  very kind  about  it.  And  then  she  said,  \"Do you  know  Laura  Lynn  Jackson?\"  And  I said,  \"Yeah,  I  just  interviewed  her  a couple  of  years  ago.\"  And  I  said, \"I have  a  mutual  friends  with  her  that  I got  introduced  through.\"  And  she  said, \"Well,  she  told  me  that  when  I'm  on  the right  path,  I'll  see  peacocks.\"  And  that particular  book  cover  I  gave  her  is Krishna  standing  there.  And  when  I  say peacocks,  the  whole  cover  is  covered  in peacock  feathers.  And  there's  two peacocks  right  there.  and  she  doesn't live  in  a  place  where  she  sees  lots  of peacocks.  It's  not  common.  And  she  said that  was  my  sign  that  I  was  on  the  right path.  And  I  thought,  how  beautiful.  I hadn't  talked  to  you  about  her.  I  hadn't talked  to  her  about  you. >> Right? >> There  was  no  colluding  or  sharing  of information.  And  here  we  were  living  in this  really  beautiful  moment  of  natural synergy  that  made  her  feel  seen,  made  me feel  really  happy.  you  were  the  the conduit  and  the  connector  of  the  two that  and  it  was  just  such  a  it  was  just such  a  special  moment  and  I  think  we either  become  so  skeptical  or  cynical  or doubtful  of  these  beautiful  moments  that we  all  have  in  our  lives. >> Yes. >> Or  we  we  do  one  of  two  things.  We  either you  know  make  them  feel  regular  and insignificant  or  we  make  them  feel  like astronomical.  And  the  truth  is  we  should just  see  them  as  beautiful  and  things  we should  start  to  notice  more.  I  feel  like there's  not  a  need  to  look  at  them  as insificant  or  the  most  significant.  It's beautiful  to  just  look  at  them  as  how wonderful  when  we're  all  in  sync >> all  in  that  flow  of  light.  There  are  so many  things  I  love  about  you  sharing that  story.  The  first  I  want  to  say  is  I love  that  the  other  side  chose  you  to  be the  messenger.  And  I  love  that  you  got this  knowing  like  this  knowing  I  need  to get  this  book  and  I'm  not  sure  why,  but I'm  going to  honor  that  knowing.  You didn't  even  know  you  were  the  messenger of  her  sign  that  she  was  on  her  highest path,  right? Embrace  that.  And  then  I  love  right  that it  showed  the  connectivity  of  the  three of  us  here  because  I've  come  to  know  too",
  "the  messenger.  And  I  love  that  you  got this  knowing  like  this  knowing  I  need  to get  this  book  and  I'm  not  sure  why,  but I'm  going to  honor  that  knowing.  You didn't  even  know  you  were  the  messenger of  her  sign  that  she  was  on  her  highest path,  right? Embrace  that.  And  then  I  love  right  that it  showed  the  connectivity  of  the  three of  us  here  because  I've  come  to  know  too like  we  have  teams  of  light  here  on  the ground  where  there  are  different  soul groups  working  to  help  in  different  ways and  everybody  you  meet  you're  meant  to meet,  right?  So  there's  that.  It's  just so  beautiful  and  it's  really  trusting  in understanding  the  power  and  the  beauty we  all  have  to  show  up  for  one  another. And  and  really  the  term  I  love  to  use  is to  be  angel  angels  in  each  other's lives. >> There  are  so  many  moments  where  each  of us  are  called  to  be  part  of  something greater  than  ourselves.  And  if  we  ignore those  little  pulls  or  those  nudges,  we miss  out  on  the  beauty.  I  like  just telling  people  too,  if  you  ever  come across  a  fundraiser,  right,  there's  a lot  of  GoFundMe  and  there's  so  many worthy  causes. Just  give  $5.  M >> just  give  $5  and  take  a  moment  after  you do  it  and  try  to  feel  the  energy  around it.  Because  when  we  come  together  as groups,  as  collective  energy  for  a cause,  for  something  good,  out  of  love, out  of  kindness,  there  is  a  collective energy  that  we  become  part  of.  And  it's so  much  bigger  than  ourselves.  And  so,  a really  good  way  to  feel  that  is  to become  part  of  something  and  then  sense it. >> You  know,  it's  really  magical.  We're  all part  of  that  every  day. >> Yeah.  And  I  just  wrote  that  down  what you  said  like  that's  it's  every  day. It's  every  day  if  you  notice  it. >> Yes. >> And  you're  so  right  that  we  notice  it and  we  doubt  ourselves  for  noticing  it and  then  it  goes  away.  Then  it  then  it's it's  still  happening  but  we  don't  see  it at  all. >> Yeah. >> And  it  stops  showing  up  for  us.  Not because  it's  not  happening  but  because we  don't  see  it. >> Yeah. >> And  it's  it's  like  living  in  a  home  and putting  all  the  blinds  down  and wondering  where  the  sun  is.  And  it's like  well  you've  blocked  yourself  from it.  So  the  sun  can't  get  in.  The  sun's still  there. >> Yeah. >> But  he  can't  get  in  the  house  anymore. >> That's  such  a  great  analogy.  And  I  think anybody  who  is  listening  to  this podcast,  this  episode  found  you  for  a reason.  Like  this  is  your  team  of  light reminding  you  that  this  is  true  for  your life,  too.  This  isn't  just  true  for  the few  stories  we're  sharing  or  the",

Like  this  is  your  team  of  light reminding  you  that  this  is  true  for  your life,  too.  This  isn't  just  true  for  the few  stories  we're  sharing  or  the experiences  we're,  you  know,  having  and and  talking  about.  It's  true  for  every single  listener  out  there.  Yeah. >> It's  just  a  matter  of  like  opening  to  it and  trusting  it  because  the  magic  is happening  and  it  has  been  happening  your whole  life. >> Yeah.  Has  anyone  ever  been  upset, disappointed  or  shocked  by  what  they heard  from  the  other  side? >> I  I'll  tell  you  this.  Anytime  that  I  do a  reading,  I  know  two  things.  I  know that  anything  that  comes  through  is  on the  person's  highest  path  to  hear.  And  I also  know  that  I'm  not  meant  to  filter anything.  I  think  that  there  have  been times  when  I  read  I  get  very  for  some reason  my  guides  work  very  closely  with me  to  give  me  very  specific  timelines for  people's  experiences  here  and sometimes  you  know  a  person's  guides  or their  loved  ones  on  the  other  side  will be  sharing  that  they  see  they're  going through  a  very  difficult  situation and  the  person  maybe  I'm  reading  for wanted  that  resolved  yesterday  and  I'll be  shown  that  it's  going  to  be  a  9-month journey  till  there's  going  to  be  a change,  but  that  there  is  a  sacredness in  that  9  months  and  they're  meant  to just  hold  space  for  this.  It's  not  going to  necessarily  get  easier,  but  they're they're  part  of  this  experience.  And  I can  see  people  at  times  being  like, \"Wait,  9  months?\"  There  have  been  times where  I've  read  for  people  who  want  to meet  their  soulmate,  their  significant other.  And  I  remember  one  reading  I  did and  I  was  being  shown  a  very  specific timeline  and  I  said  to  the  person, \"This  person's  coming.  His  name  is  going to  start  with  a  C,  but  you're  not  going to  meet  him  for  about  2  and  1/2  years. And  they  that  this  was  so  upset.  What  do you  mean  I  have  to  wait  2  and  1/2  years? And  granted,  that's  not  the  best  news, right?  Well,  it  turned  out  in  the  end, this  person  did  meet  the  person  with  the same  name.  It  did  turn  out  to  be  this soulmate  they  married  and  had  children with.  But  the  person  at  the  time  of  our reading  was  actually  married  to  somebody else  at  the  time  and  was  about  to because  I  think  that  spiritual  contract they  had  learned  what  they  were  supposed to  learn.  They  ended  up  getting  divorced",
  "right?  Well,  it  turned  out  in  the  end, this  person  did  meet  the  person  with  the same  name.  It  did  turn  out  to  be  this soulmate  they  married  and  had  children with.  But  the  person  at  the  time  of  our reading  was  actually  married  to  somebody else  at  the  time  and  was  about  to because  I  think  that  spiritual  contract they  had  learned  what  they  were  supposed to  learn.  They  ended  up  getting  divorced and  then  this  unfolded  which  is  also really  interesting  when  you  think  of marriages,  right?  And  how  sometimes  we look  at  divorce  as  being  the  failure  of a  marriage  when  actually  that  was exactly  how  that  relationship  was supposed  to  play  out.  staying  stuck  in relationships  that  no  longer  serve  us  or help  us  to  grow.  That's  a  swamp.  That's not  going  to  help  anybody.  So,  getting to  that  moment  within  yourself  where  you say  like,  I  honor  everything  I  gained from  this  relationship.  I  honor everything  I  learned.  I  release  you  in love,  but  I  understand  our  contract  is up  and  our  journey  is  up  so  that  you  can be  brought  on  a  path  to  something  else. I  think  so  often  we  are  so  mean  to ourselves  in  terms  of  like  how  we  frame what  we've  experienced  in  the  past  as  a failure  or  just  like  a  waste  of  time. Nothing  is  a  waste  of  time. >> I  I  actually  say  that  often  to  people. I'm  like  as  humans  we  have  this  ability to  be  like  well  the  last  3  years  were  a waste  of  time.  Now  I'm  in  the  right place. >> And  then  3  years  from  now  whatever  it  is you  said  the  same  thing.  Oh  god  the  last one  and  a  half  years  were  a  waste  of time.  Now  I'm  in  the  right  place.  And all  you're  doing  is  you're  just  taking away  all  this  learning  growth.  your struggle,  your  resilience  away  from yourself  rather  than  being  like,  well, these  three  years  taught  me  X  and  now  I have  that. >> Yeah. >> And  it's  Yeah,  it's  it's  such  a  great point  and  I  didn't  connect  it  to  your work,  but  now  I  get  that. >> You  know,  I  love  what  you're  bringing up,  too.  Yeah.  I  spent  almost  20  years as  a  high  school  English  teacher  and  at the  end  of  every  year  I  would  have students  do  a  final  assignment  which  was a  reflection  of  their  journey  through literature  throughout  the  year  through their  own  creative  writing  throughout the  year  what  they  learned  how  they changed  and  it  would  be  so  profound  and first  they'd  grumble  when  they  got  the assignment  oh  I  have  to  reflect  on  it but  I  think  it's  such  a  powerful  moment for  each  and  every  us  every  one  of  us  to create  some  space  to  reflect  and  what you're  saying  just  makes  me  recognize.  I think  it  would  be  so  wonderful  for everybody  who's  listening  to  this podcast  to  take  a  moment  and  maybe  sit down  quietly  with  a  pen  and  paper  or  at",
  "but  I  think  it's  such  a  powerful  moment for  each  and  every  us  every  one  of  us  to create  some  space  to  reflect  and  what you're  saying  just  makes  me  recognize.

Because  when  we  get  in  these  moments  of journaling  or  writing  too,  we're  in  a state  of  connectivity  with  the  other side  and  information  will  be  downloaded to  us.  And  we  can  also  hear  our  soul speak >> and  it  can  change  how  we're  thinking about  our  entire  journeys  and  our  entire paths  here. >> Mhm.  I  love  that. >> Yeah. >> Lauren,  it  has  been  such  a  joy  talking to  you  again.  Truly,  I'm  so  grateful that  you  wrote  Guided,  the  secret  path to  an  Illuminated  Life.  I  can't  wait  for people  to  read  it. >> Thank  you.  Uh,  I  I  enjoy  our conversation  so  much  because  just  being in  your  presence,  I  feel  more  tuned  in. I  feel  I  I  feel  more  naturally  connected and  I  think  that  says  a  lot  for  the  work you  do.  And  I'm  so  grateful  for  the  work you  do  and  reminding  us  of  all  these beautiful  abilities  that  we  all  have, that  we  forget,  that  we  doubt,  that  we put  aside  with  our  logical  brains.  And I'm  just  really,  really  thankful  that  we got  to  do  this  again.  So,  thank  you  so much. >> Thank  you  so  much.  I'm  so  honored  to  be in  conversation  with  you.  and  you  give off  so  much  light  and  I  think  anybody listening  can  feel  that  vibration  and feel  that  energy.  I  feel  just  listening to  you  speak  and  discuss  and  dive  into these  things  expands  them.  So  thank  you for  all  the  work  you  do  in  the  world. >> Thank  you  Laura  Lynn.  I  hope  everyone will  go  and  grab  a  copy  of  Guided  the Secret  Path  to  an  illuminated  life.  It's available  right  now.
